\chapter{An Implementational Framework \\ for the DG-PEM} \label{ch:implementation}
%
The implementation of a given partitioned element method must address two primary challenges: the subdivision of an element into cells, and the solution of shape function boundary value problems by way of the chosen PEM formulation. The first of these two tasks may be accomplished by various means. However, careful attention must be paid to the stability requirements of the PEM, such that the resulting quadrature cell partition yields stable approximations to harmonic shape functions, and a stable integration rule for the element. Specifying such a discretization is not trivial for arbitrary shapes. For this reason, we will confine our attention to strictly star-convex elements, for which we propose a relatively simple (edge-based) element partitioning algorithm.

The present implementational framework is directed at obtaining DG-PEM approximations to harmonic shape functions on arbitrary polytopes -- i.e. solving (\ref{eq:dg_poisson}) on an appropriately defined partition of the element. A discussion of the pertinent data structures and solution methods is provided.

\section{Arbitrary Polytopal Meshes}

	Traditional finite element methods typically permit the elements to only take the form of certain canonical shapes with fixed topology (most commonly tetrahedra or hexahedra). This yields several benefits with regard to the data and storage requirements necessary to represent a given element in a computational setting. Frequently, it suffices to describe the geometry of a canonical shape (such as a hexahedron) by providing a list of the element's nodal coordinates, along with an ordered sequence of the element's nodal IDs, which fully determines its resulting topology according to some conventional node numbering scheme (refer to Figure \ref{fig:canonical_orderings} as a representative example.)
	\begin{figure} [!ht]

		\label{fig:canonical_orderings}
	\end{figure}
	
	Polytopal elements with arbitrary topology (with a variable number of nodes, edges, and faces) cannot be represented in this fashion. As a consequence, more descriptive data structures are necessary to fully determine a polytopal element's nodal connectivity. A particular scheme to represent an arbitrary polyhedron in a finite element mesh is described in the following section.

\subsection*{Geometric Data Structures for Arbitrary Polytopes}

	There are multiple ways in which the geometry of a given polyhedral element $\Omega$ may be represented within a finite element code. Ideally, however, the chosen data structure should be made as compact as possible, for the sake of minimizing the storage requirements of a single element. This section describes a few basic data structures for storing arbitrary polygonal and polyhedral shapes within an unstructured finite element mesh.
	
	The geometric data used to describe a typical finite element mesh consists of the following:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A list of the spatial coordinates $\left\{ \mathbf{X}_a \right\}_{a=1}^{N^{\mathcal{B}_0}_V}$ for all nodes in the mesh. The sub-index $a \in 1, \ldots, N^{\mathcal{B}_0}_V$ induces a \textit{global node ID} ascribed to each node.
		\item A list of all elements $\left\{ \Omega_{e} \right\}_{e = 1}^{N^{\mathcal{B}_0}_\Omega}$ where $\Omega_{e} \subset \mathcal{B}_0$. The sub-index $e \in 1, \ldots, N^{\mathcal{B}_0}_\Omega$ induces an associated \textit{element ID}.
		\item A list of all faces $\left\{ F_{b} \right\}_{b = 1}^{N^{\Gamma^N_0}_F}$ where $F_{b} \subset \Gamma^N_0$ to which traction boundary conditions are assigned. Likewise, the sub-index $b \in 1, \ldots, N^{\Gamma^N_0}_F$ induces a \textit{boundary face ID}.
	\end{itemize}
	
	In a finite element mesh consisting of arbitrary polyhedral elements, it is suggested that each element $\Omega_e$ be represented by the following data:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A list of the global node IDs $\left\{ a_i \right\}_{i=1}^{N^{\Omega_e}_V}$ comprising the set of nodes belonging to $\Omega_e$. The sub-index $i \in 1, \ldots, N^{\Omega_e}_V$ induces a \textit{local node ID}, particular to the element $\Omega_e$.
		\item A list of the polygonal faces $\left\{ F_{j} \right\}_{j=1}^{N^{\Omega_e}_F}$ which belong to $\partial \Omega_e$; each polygonal face $F_j$ is in turn represented by a cycle of local node IDs denoted $\left\{ n_i \right\}_{i=1}^{N^{F_j}_V}$, which further determine each face's outward orientation with respect to the element $\Omega_e$.
	\end{itemize}
	An illustration of this collection of data for a given polyhedron $\Omega_e$ is provided in Figure \ref{fig:polyhedron_data}.
	\begin{figure} [!ht]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width = 6.0in]{figures/polyhedron_data.pdf}
		\caption{Illustration of the data necessary to describe an arbitrary polyhedral element $\Omega_e$. The local node ID ordering for the face $F_1$ shown would be $\left\{ n_i \right\}_{i=1}^{5} = \left\{ 14, \, 1, \, 9, \, 8, \, 13 \right\}$.}
		\label{fig:polyhedron_data}
	\end{figure}
	
	A given polygonal face $F_b \subset \Gamma^N_0$ will similarly be represented by:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A list of the global node IDs $\left\{ a_i \right\}_{i=1}^{N^{F_b}_V}$ which belong to $F_b$.
		\item A list of the linear edges $\left\{ E_{c} \right\}_{c=1}^{N^{F_b}_E}$ which belong to $\partial F_b$; each linear edge $E_c$ is in turn represented as an ordered list of local node IDs $\left\{ n_i \right\}_{i=1}^{N^{E_c}_V}$.
	\end{itemize}
	
	Unlike canonical finite element shapes, the ordering of the element's nodal IDs is effectively arbitrary, and does not induce a topology. Rather, the element's topology is determined by virtue of its polygonal faces, and their respective (conventionally clockwise) local node orderings. Consequently, each edge of a given polyhedron is defined implicitly as the intersection of two adjacent faces' ordered node sets. Such a scheme may be easily generalized to accomodate serendipity elements containing additional nodes along element edges, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:polyhedron_data_quadratic}.
	\begin{figure} [!ht]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width = 6.0in]{figures/polyhedron_data_quadratic.pdf}
		\caption{Illustration of the data necessary to describe a quadratic serendipity polyhedral element $\Omega_e$. The local node ID ordering for the face $F_1$ shown would be $\left\{ n_i \right\}_{i=1}^{10} = \left\{ 14, \, 34, \, 1, \, 18, \, 9, \, 26, \, 8, \, 32, \, 13, \, 33 \right\}$.}
		\label{fig:polyhedron_data_quadratic}
	\end{figure}
	
\subsection*{Finite Element Data for Arbitrary Polytopes}

	Traditional Lagrangian finite element methods require each element $\Omega_e \subset \mathcal{B}_0$ to carry the following data (at a minimum) for the purposes of evaluating weak form integrals:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A list of quadrature weights $\left\{ w_q \right\}_{q=1}^{N^{\Omega_e}_{qp}}$ associated with the quadrature points of the element. The sub-index $q$ induces a local \textit{quadrature point ID}.
		\item Evaluations of the element's nodal shape functions $\left\{ \varphi_a (\mathbf{X}_q) \right\}_{q=1}^{N^{\Omega_e}_{qp}} \, \, \forall a = 1, \ldots, N^{\Omega_e}_V$ at each quadrature point location $\mathbf{X}_q$.
		\item Gradients (with respect to the element's reference coordinates $\mathbf{X}$ at time $t = 0$) of the element's nodal shape functions $\left\{ \nabla_X \varphi_a (\mathbf{X}_q) \right\}_{q=1}^{N^{\Omega_e}_{qp}} \, \, \forall a = 1, \ldots, N^{\Omega_e}_V$.
		\item (Optionally) if the element relies upon some form of gradient correction scheme (or more generally, if a Petrov-Galerkin method is employed): evaluations and/or gradients of the element's test functions $\left\{ \phi_a (\mathbf{X}_q), \, \nabla_X \phi_a (\mathbf{X}_q) \right\}_{q=1}^{N^{\Omega_e}_{qp}} \, \, \forall a = 1, \ldots, N^{\Omega_e}_V$ must be stored, as well.
	\end{itemize}
	For solid mechanics applications, material state data (e.g. material properties, internal variables, Cauchy stress) would also need to be stored at each quadrature point location.
	
	Similarly, each boundary face $F_b \subset \Gamma^N_0$ must carry:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A list of quadrature weights $\left\{ w_q \right\}_{q=1}^{N^{F_b}_{qp}}$ for each quadrature point of the face.
		\item Evaluations of the face's nodal shape functions $\left\{ \varphi_a (\mathbf{X}_q) \right\}_{q=1}^{N^{F_b}_{qp}} \, \, \forall a = 1, \ldots, N^{F_b}_V$ at each quadrature point location $\mathbf{X}_q$.
		\item Gradients (with respect to the face's in-plane reference coordinates $\mathbf{X}$ at $t = 0$) of the face's nodal shape functions $\left\{ \nabla_X \varphi_a (\mathbf{X}_q) \right\}_{q=1}^{N^{F_b}_{qp}} \, \, \forall a = 1, \ldots, N^{F_b}_V$.
		\item If a Petrov-Galerkin method is employed: evaluations and/or gradients of the face's test functions $\left\{ \phi_a (\mathbf{X}_q), \, \nabla_X \phi_a (\mathbf{X}_q) \right\}_{q=1}^{N^{F_b}_{qp}} \, \, \forall a = 1, \ldots, N^{F_b}_V$.
		\item Outward unit normals $\left\{ \mathbf{N}_q \right\}_{q=1}^{N^{F_b}_{qp}}$ to the face $F_b$ at each quadrature point.
	\end{itemize}
	
	The data enumerated above must be determined by means of a specified formulation for how the element's (face's) shape functions and quadrature rule should be constructed. Partitioned element methods address precisely this task. Given an abstract representation for the geometry of a given polyhedral element $\Omega$ (as discussed in the previous section), a PEM formulation proceeds in a number of distinct steps:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[1.)] The element (and its faces, edges) are appropriately partitioned into cells (facets, segments, verticies).
		\item[2a.)] Individual nodal shape functions are constructed along each edge $E$ of the element.
		\item[2b.)] Individual nodal shape functions are constructed on each face $F$ of the element.
		\item[2c.)] Individual nodal shape functions are constructed on the interior of the element $\Omega$.
		\item[3.)] The discrete finite element data (including quadrature point evaluations of the shape functions and their gradients) are computed and stored by the element.
		\item[4.)] Any auxiliary data (regarding the element's partitioned geometry, etc.) is discarded.
	\end{itemize}
	
	Depending on how the chosen PEM is carried out, the above process can ammount to a relatively large computational expense. However, if a total Lagrangian approach is empolyed within the associated finite element analysis, then the above methodology would only need to be carried out once for each element, at the beginning of the simulation (prior to the first time step). Consequently, the cost of constructing element shape functions in this manner is amortized over the duration of the analysis.
	
	The subsequent sections of this chapter are dedicated to a more detailed discussion of the aforementioned steps taken to construct a given element's partition, and its shape functions.
	
\section{Element Partitioning Schemes}

	The process of obtaining a suitable partition for a given element constitutes the greatest challenge facing partitioned element methods. The primary complication arises from the conditions of stability: the shape function approximations, and the corresponding quadrature rules defined on the element's partition must guarantee a sufficiently stable integration of the weak form. For relatively simple shapes, a number of stable partitioning schemes exist. However, for arbitrary shapes, it becomes difficult -- if not impossible -- for a heuristically-driven discretization scheme to guarantee that the resulting partition will satisfy the aforementioned stabilily requirements.

	For this reason, we will limit our subsequent discussion to star-convex element geometries. For such shapes, a relatively simple partitioning scheme is suggested, resembling the decomposition used in the edge-based smoothed finite element method. In the absence of degenerate features, the resulting partition is verified to provide sufficiently stable shape function approximations and quadrature rules.

\subsection*{Edge-Based Partitioning for Star-Convex Elements}

	A star-convex shape $\Omega$ is one for which there exists some point $\mathbf{X}^{\Omega}_0 \in \Omega$ such that the line segment connecting any point $\mathbf{X} \in \Omega$ to $\mathbf{X}^{\Omega}_0$ is entirely contained within $\Omega$. If $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ refers to a polyhedron which is star-convex, this further implies that each polygonal face $F \subset \partial \Omega$ is also star-convex with respect to some point $\mathbf{X}^{F}_0 \in F$. Any linear edge $E \subset \partial F$ is star-convex with respect to any point $\mathbf{X} \in E$.
	
	A simple and efficient partitioning scheme is described for polyhedral elements $\Omega$ (and their polygonal faces $F_j$) which are star-convex with respect to their vertex-averaged centroids $\bar{\mathbf{X}}^{\Omega}_0$ (or $\bar{\mathbf{X}}^{F_j}_0$), i.e.
	\begin{equation}
		\bar{\mathbf{X}}^{\Omega}_0 = \frac{1}{N^{\Omega}_V} \sum_{i = 1}^{N^{\Omega}_V} \mathbf{X}_{i}, \quad \text{and} \quad \bar{\mathbf{X}}^{F_j}_0 = \frac{1}{N^{F_j}_V} \sum_{i = 1}^{N^{F_j}_V} \mathbf{X}_{i}.
	\end{equation}
	
	For a given polyhedral element $\Omega$, the algorithm proceeds in several steps:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[1.)] Identify all edges of the polyhedron, and subdivide them into linear segements; each segment should join two adjacent nodes of a given edge.
		\item[2.)] For each face, compute its vertex-averaged centroid $\bar{\mathbf{X}}^{F_j}_0$, and subdivide the face into triangular facets which emanate from $\bar{\mathbf{X}}^{F_j}_0$; each facet should share at most two segments (at least one segment) with $\partial F_j$.
		\item[3a.)] Compute the element's vertex-averaged centroid $\bar{\mathbf{X}}^{\Omega}_0$, and subdivide the element into tetrahedra which emanate from $\bar{\mathbf{X}}^{\Omega}_0$; each tetrahedron should share a single facet with $\partial \Omega$.
		\item[3b.)] Lump into cells any tetrahedra which share a segment belonging to an edge of $\Omega$; each cell should consist of exactly two tetrahedra.
	\end{itemize}
	An illustration of this process is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:partitioning_algorithm}. A similar agorithm may be applied to each boundary face $F_b \subset \Gamma^N_0$, entailing only the first two steps.

		\caption{The resulting segment, facet, and cell decomposition for the proposed edge-based partitioning algorithm.}
		\label{fig:partitioning_algorithm}
	\end{figure}
	
	The algorithm can also be naturally extended to accomodate serendipity polyhedral elements, with additional nodes belonging to element edges, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:partitioning_algorithm_quadratic}.

	\end{figure}

\section{Abstract Geometric Data Structures}

	Because partitioned element methods consist of solving a set of 1D, 2D, and 3D problems on each edge, face, and element, there arise a number of similarities between these problems of variable dimension. Namely, the geometric data describing each cell, facet, segment and vertex may be abstracted through the use of generic parent-child (tree-based) data structures. Instead of requiring a separate implementation for the solution of each 1D, 2D, 3D problem, generic programming paradigms are exploited to facilitate a single, unified implementation which is agnostic to the dimensionality of the problem being solved. The proposed organization shares many similarities with the generic programming approaches presented in \cite{Cicuttin:17}. A number of definitions for the abstract data structures used henceforth are given in the following sections.
	
\subsection*{Geometric Entities}

	\textit{Geometric entities} (or simply \textit{entities}) are defined as the atomic units of the element's geometric partition. An entity may be: a polyhedral cell, a polygonal facet, a linear segment, or a vertex. Entities are defined in terms of their relationship to other geometric entities. Specifically, a $3-$dimensional entity (a polyhedral cell $\omega$) is uniquely defined in terms of its $2$-dimensional facets $\sigma \subset \partial \omega$ (termed the ``children'' of $\omega$). Each facet $\sigma$ is in turn considered a $2$-dimensional entity, defined in terms of its $1$-dimensional children (its bounding segements $\gamma \subset \partial \sigma$). An entity of dimension $0$ (a vertex) is identified as having no children.
	
	Each geometric entity may be viewed as a ``node'' in a corresponding tree diagram, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:entity_tree}, where the height of a given entity within the tree structure indicates its dimensionality $d$.
	\begin{figure} [!ht]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width = 5.0in]{figures/entity_tree.pdf}
		\caption{A representative entity tree diagram for a $2$-dimensional facet $\sigma$ and its children.}
		\label{fig:entity_tree}
	\end{figure}
	
	Henceforth, we denote by $\varepsilon$ any generic $d-$dimensional entity, and by $\zeta$ any $(d-1)$-dimensional child of $\varepsilon$ (such that $\zeta \subset \partial \varepsilon$). The data stored on a given entity $\varepsilon$ consists of:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Information (pointers or entity IDs) refering to the $(d-1)$-dimensional children of $\varepsilon$, and/or information (pointers or entity IDs) refering to the $(d+1)$-dimensional parents of $\varepsilon$.
		\item An (optional) orientation/unit direction $\mathbf{N}_\varepsilon$.
		\item A quadrature rule $\left\{ \mathbf{X}_q, w_q \right\}_{q=1}^{N^{\varepsilon}_{qp}}$ defined on $\varepsilon$, or pre-computed monomial integrals $\int_{\varepsilon} \mathbf{X}^\alpha \, d \varepsilon$ for all $|\alpha| \leq k$ (alternatively, the shifted monomial moments $\int_{\varepsilon} (\mathbf{X}-\mathbf{X}_{\varepsilon})^\alpha \, d \varepsilon$ may be computed and stored, instead.)
		\item A list of the DG-PEM basis function IDs which are associated with $\varepsilon$.
	\end{itemize}
	
	If quadrature rules are to be defined on each geometric entity, we may exploit the particular choice made regarding the element's edge-based partition, noting that every polygonal facet will be a triangle, and every polyhedral cell will consist of two adjoining tetrahedra, allowing for the use of standard Dunavant \cite{Dunavant:85} and Grundmann-M\"{o}ller \cite{Grundmann:78} quadrature rules for triangles and tetrahedra, respectively. Standard Gaussian quadrature rules may be specified on each linear segment.
	
	The advantage of defining entities in this fashion is that it affords greater flexibility in solving the DG-PEM problem (\ref{eq:dg_poisson}) on elements with arbitrary dimensionality.
	
\subsection*{Sub-Elements}

	Herein, a \textit{sub-element} (generically denoted as $\mathcal{E}$) is defined as a $d-$dimensional polytope (a polyhedral element, a polygonal face, a linear edge, or a node) upon which nodal shape functions are locally constructed and defined as the solution to a $d-$dimensional boundary value problem. Sub-elements consist of a partition $\mathcal{T}_{\varepsilon} (\mathcal{E})$ of $\mathcal{E}$ into $d-$dimensional entities $\varepsilon$. The boundary of each sub-element $\mathcal{E}$ is comprised of $(d-1)-$dimensional sub-elements, denoted $e \subset \partial \mathcal{E}$ (called the ``children'' of $\mathcal{E}$, in analog to the terminology used for geometric entities). A sub-element of dimension $0$ (a node) refers to a single vertex, and possesses no children.
	
	As a representative example, consider the face $F \subset \partial \Omega$ shown in Figure \ref{fig:sub_element}, which is classified as a $2-$dimensional sub-element, whose partition $\mathcal{T}_\sigma (F)$ consists of $2-$dimensional facets $\sigma \subset F$. The children of $F$ are comprised of $1-$dimensional sub-elements -- edges $E \subset \partial F$; in turn, the children of each edge $E$ are the nodes of the element. As with geometric entities, the parent-child relationships between different sub-elements induces a tree-like data stucture, where the height of a given sub-element within the tree corresponds to its dimensionality $d$.
	\begin{figure} [!ht]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width = 6.0in]{figures/sub_element.pdf}
		\caption{A representative $2$-dimensional sub-element $F \subset \partial \Omega$ (a polygonal face), and its corresponding sub-element tree diagram. The partition of $F$ consists of polygonal facets $\sigma_i \in \mathcal{T}_{\sigma} (F) \, \, \forall i = 1, \ldots, 5$.}
		\label{fig:sub_element}
	\end{figure}
	
	The data stored for a given sub-element $\mathcal{E}$ consists of:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Information (pointers or entity IDs) refering to the $d$-dimensional entities $\varepsilon \in \mathcal{T}_\varepsilon (\mathcal{E})$ belonging to the partition of $\mathcal{E}$.
		\item Information (pointers or sub-element IDs) refering to the $(d-1)$-dimensional children of $\mathcal{E}$ (the sub-elements $e \subset \partial \mathcal{E}$ which constitute the boundary of $\mathcal{E}$).
		\item A list of the DG-PEM basis function IDs which are defined on $\mathcal{T}_\varepsilon (\mathcal{E})$.
	\end{itemize}
	
	A more through discussion is dedicated to the subject of DG-PEM basis functions in the following section.
	
\section{Partition-Based Approximation Spaces}

		As discussed in chapter \ref{ch:pem}, partitioned element methods consider a weak formulation of a given PDE (e.g. Laplace's equation), whose solution is approximated through the specification of a finite dimensional function space $\mathcal{U}^h (\mathcal{E})$ defined on the partition $\mathcal{T}_{\varepsilon} (\mathcal{E})$ of a given sub-element $\mathcal{E}$. The (sub-)element's shape functions are selected as the ``best approximations'' to (harmonic) functions which are contained within the chosen approximation space $\mathcal{U}^h (\mathcal{E})$.
		
		Herein, we consider $\mathcal{U}^h (\mathcal{E})$ to be spanned by a set of basis functions $\left\{ \psi_A \right\}_{A=1}^{N^{\mathcal{E}}_{bf}}$, such that each basis function $\psi \in \mathcal{U}^h (\mathcal{E})$ is compactly supported over a given geometric entity $\varepsilon \in \mathcal{T}_\varepsilon (\mathcal{E})$ (or patch of entities).
		
		Any function $\varphi^h \in \mathcal{U}^h (\mathcal{E})$ may be written as a linear combination of the basis functions which span $\mathcal{U}^h (\mathcal{E})$, i.e.
		\begin{equation}
			\varphi^h (\mathbf{X}) = \sum_{A=1}^{N^{\mathcal{E}}_{bf}} \psi_A (\mathbf{X}) \, \varphi_A \quad \forall \mathbf{X} \in \mathcal{E}.
		\end{equation}
		The restriction of $\varphi^h$ to a given geometric entity $\varepsilon$ may be written in terms of only those basis functions $\left\{ \psi^\varepsilon_{a} \right\}_{a=1}^{N^\varepsilon_{bf}} \subset \mathcal{U}^h (\Omega)$ which possess compact support over $\varepsilon$, such that
		\begin{equation}
			\varphi^h|_\varepsilon (\mathbf{X}) = \sum_{a=1}^{N^\varepsilon_{bf}} \psi^\varepsilon_{a} (\mathbf{X}) \, \varphi_{a} \quad \forall \mathbf{X} \in \varepsilon.
		\end{equation}
		
		To guarantee $P^k (\mathcal{E}) \subset \mathcal{U}^h (\mathcal{E})$ for some desired degree of polynomial completeness $k$, it is necessary for a given entity's local basis $\left\{ \psi^\varepsilon_{a} \right\}_{a=1}^{N^\varepsilon_{bf}}$ to span $P^k (\varepsilon)$. Arguably the simplest such basis consists of the monomials through order $k$ defined on each entity $\varepsilon \in \mathcal{T}_\varepsilon (\mathcal{E})$. However, the use of (unscaled) monomial bases can lead to ill-conditioning of the DG-PEM problem, particularly as the maximal polynomial degree $k$ is increased. This fact has been well-established in the literature pertaining to discontinuous Galerkin methods (see for example \cite{Hesthaven:10}.) An exploration of the condition number for the resulting DG-PEM systems of equations is presented at the end of this chapter. For this reason, other (well-scaled) polynomial bases are recommended, such as the Lagrange polynomials defined on each entity (for linear segments and triangular facets), or the orthogonal polynomials obtained via the methodology proposed in \cite{Bassi:12}.
		
		Regardless of the chosen basis, each basis function $\psi (\mathbf{X})$ may be expressed as a low-order polynomial (of maximal degree $k$) via a linear combination of (possibly shifted) monomials:
		\begin{equation}
			\psi (\mathbf{X}) = \sum_{|\alpha| \leq k} c_\alpha (\mathbf{X}-\mathbf{X}_0)^{\alpha},
		\end{equation}
		where $\alpha = \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_d$ is a multi-index, such that $|\alpha| = \alpha_1 + \ldots + \alpha_2$ and $\mathbf{X}^\alpha = X_1^{\alpha_1} \cdots X_d^{\alpha_d}$. Consequently, a given basis function is uniquely defined in terms of its shifted coordinate $\mathbf{X}_0$, and its monomial coefficients $c_\alpha$. The gradient of a given basis function $\nabla \psi (\mathbf{X})$ may in turn be computed via
		\begin{equation}
			\frac{\partial \psi (\mathbf{X})}{\partial X_i} = \sum_{|\alpha| \leq k} \alpha_i c_\alpha (\mathbf{X}-\mathbf{X}_0)^{\alpha_1, \ldots, (\alpha_i - 1), \ldots, \alpha_d}.
		\end{equation}
		
\section{Linearization and Assembly of the \\ DG-PEM Systems of Equations}

	The DG-PEM problem of (\ref{eq:dg_poisson}) may be written as a linear system of equations arising from the chosen basis $\left\{ \psi_A \right\}_{A=1}^{N^\mathcal{E}_{bf}}$ for $\mathcal{U}^h (\mathcal{E})$, such that the basis function coefficients $\varphi_A \, \, \forall A = 1, \ldots, N^\mathcal{E}_{bf}$ representing a given shape function $\varphi^h (\mathbf{X}) = \sum_{A=1}^{N^\mathcal{E}_{bf}} \psi_A (\mathbf{X}) \, \varphi_A$ may be determined as the solution to:
	\begin{equation}
		\sum_{A=1}^{N^\mathcal{E}_{bf}} J_{AB} \, \varphi_A = F_B \quad \forall B = 1, \ldots, N^\mathcal{E}_{bf},
		\label{eq:linearization_dgpem}
	\end{equation}
	where $J_{AB}$ and $F_B$ are computed via an entity-wise assembly process (akin to the methodology employed for assembling finite element systems of equations). However, in addition to assembling local contributions $J^\varepsilon_{ab}$ and $F^\varepsilon_b$ to $J_{AB}$ and $F_B$ from all $d$-dimensional entities $\varepsilon \in \mathcal{T}_\varepsilon (\mathcal{E})$, here it is also necessary to assemble appropriate contributions from all $(d-1)$-dimensional interfaces $\zeta \in \Gamma_\varepsilon \cup \partial \mathcal{E}$, as well.

	Specifically, each $d$-dimensional entity $\varepsilon \in \mathcal{T}_\varepsilon (\mathcal{E})$ contributes the following local arrays:
	\begin{equation}
			J^{\varepsilon}_{ab} = \int_{\varepsilon} \nabla \psi^{\varepsilon}_{a} \, \cdot \nabla \psi^{\varepsilon}_{b} \, d \varepsilon, \quad \forall a, \, b = 1, \ldots, N^{\varepsilon}_{bf},
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}
			F^{\varepsilon}_b = \int_{\varepsilon} f_{\mathcal{E}} \, \psi_b^{\varepsilon} \, d \varepsilon \quad \forall b = 1, \ldots, N^{\varepsilon}_{bf},
	\end{equation}
	each $\zeta \in \partial \mathcal{E}$ (which borders a single $d$-dimensional entity $\varepsilon$) contributes:
	\begin{equation}
			J^{\varepsilon}_{ab} = \int_{\zeta} \bigg( \epsilon \,  \mathbf{N}_{\zeta} \cdot \nabla \psi^{\varepsilon}_a \, \psi^{\varepsilon}_b - \psi^{\varepsilon}_a \, \nabla \psi^{\varepsilon}_b \cdot \mathbf{N}_{\zeta} \bigg) \, d \zeta + \frac{\alpha_{\zeta0}}{|\zeta|^{\beta_0}} \int_{\zeta} \psi_a^{\varepsilon} \, \psi_b^{\varepsilon} \, d \zeta \quad \forall a, \, b = 1, \ldots, N^{\varepsilon}_{bf},
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}
		F^{\varepsilon}_b = \int_{\zeta} \epsilon \, \bar{\varphi} \, \nabla \psi_b^{\varepsilon} \cdot \mathbf{N}_{\zeta} \, d \zeta + \frac{\alpha_{\zeta0}}{|\zeta|^{\beta_0}} \int_{\zeta} \bar{\varphi} \, \psi_b^{\varepsilon} \, d \zeta \quad \forall b = 1, \ldots, N^{\varepsilon}_{bf},
		\label{eq:boundary_term}
	\end{equation}
	and each $\zeta \in \Gamma_\varepsilon$ (which borders two $d$-dimensional entities, $\varepsilon_1$ and $\varepsilon_2$) contributes:
	\begin{align}
			J^{\varepsilon_i \varepsilon_j}_{ab} & = - \frac{1}{2} \int_{\zeta} \bigg( (-1)^{j} \, \epsilon \, \mathbf{N}_{\zeta} \cdot \nabla \psi_a^{\varepsilon_i} \, \psi_b^{\varepsilon_j} - (-1)^{i} \psi_a^{\varepsilon_i} \, \nabla \psi_b^{\varepsilon_j} \cdot \mathbf{N}_{\zeta} \bigg) \, d \zeta \\

			& + (-1)^{|i-j|} \frac{\alpha_{\zeta1}}{|\zeta|^{\beta_1}} \int_{\zeta} \nabla \psi_a^{\varepsilon_i} \cdot (\mathbf{N}_\zeta \otimes \mathbf{N}_\zeta) \cdot \nabla \psi_b^{\varepsilon_j} \, d \zeta
	\end{align}
	for all $i, \, j = 1, \, 2$, and $a = 1, \ldots, N^{\varepsilon_i}_{bf}$, $b = 1, \ldots, N^{\varepsilon_j}_{bf}$. For the remainder of our discussions, we will consider only the case where $f_\mathcal{E} \equiv 0$ for all sub-elements $\mathcal{E} \subset \Omega$.
	
	For a given $d$-dimensional sub-element $\mathcal{E}$, the assembly of the above terms entails an entity-wise integration of products between basis functions (and their gradients) over $d$-dimensional entities $\varepsilon \in \mathcal{T}_\varepsilon (\mathcal{E})$ and their $(d-1)$-dimensional children $\zeta \in \Gamma_\varepsilon \cup \partial \mathcal{E}$. This may be effected through the use of appropriately defined quadrature rules on each entity, or by pre-computing the monomial integrals over each entity up to some sufficiently high degree (nominally $2k$).
	
	Additionally, it is remarked that the boundary condition $\bar{\varphi}$ is defined independently on every $(d-1)$-dimensional sub-element $e \subset \partial \mathcal{E}$, such that its restriction $\bar{\varphi}|_\zeta$ may be written in terms of the local basis functions $\left\{ \psi^{\zeta}_c \right\}_{c=1}^{N^\zeta_{bf}}$ belonging to a given boundary entity $\zeta \in \mathcal{T}_{\zeta} (e)$, i.e.
	\begin{equation}
			\bar{\varphi}|_\zeta (\mathbf{X}) = \sum_{c=1}^{N^\zeta_{bf}} \psi^\zeta_c (\mathbf{X}) \, \bar{\varphi}_c.
	\end{equation}
	For a given $\zeta \in \partial \mathcal{E}$, this yields:
	\begin{equation}
		F^{\varepsilon}_b = \sum_{c=1}^{N^\zeta_{bf}} \bar{J}^{\varepsilon}_{bc} \, \bar{\varphi}_c \quad \forall b = 1, \ldots, N^{\varepsilon}_{bf},
	\end{equation}
	which may be used in lieu of (\ref{eq:boundary_term}), where
	\begin{equation}
		\bar{J}^{\varepsilon}_{bc} = \int_{\zeta} \epsilon \, \psi^\zeta_c \, \nabla \psi_b^{\varepsilon} \cdot \mathbf{N}_{\zeta} \, d \zeta + \frac{\alpha_{\zeta0}}{|\zeta|^{\beta_0}} \int_{\zeta} \psi^\zeta_c \, \psi_b^{\varepsilon} \, d \zeta \quad \forall b = 1, \ldots, N^{\varepsilon}_{bf}, \, c = 1, \ldots, N^\zeta_{bf}.
	\end{equation}
	Consequently, we may re-write the right-hand side of (\ref{eq:linearization_dgpem}) as a linear mapping from the basis coefficients $\bar{\varphi}_C$ which determine the boundary function $\bar{\varphi} (\mathbf{X}) = \sum_{C=1}^{N^{\partial \mathcal{E}}_{bf}} \psi_C (\mathbf{X}) \, \bar{\varphi}_C$:
	\begin{equation}
		\sum_{A=1}^{N^{\mathcal{E}}_{bf}} J_{AB} \, \varphi_A = \sum_{C=1}^{N^{\partial \mathcal{E}}_{bf}} \bar{J}_{BC} \, \bar{\varphi}_C \quad \forall B = 1, \ldots, N^{\mathcal{E}}_{bf},
	\end{equation}
	which may alternatively be written in matrix-vector format:
	\begin{equation}
		\mathbf{J} \, \boldsymbol{\varphi} = \bar{\mathbf{J}} \, \bar{\boldsymbol{\varphi}}.
		\label{eq:dgpem_linear_system}
	\end{equation}
	
	The above system of equations can be solved to obtain a linear mapping from $\bar{\boldsymbol{\varphi}}$ to $\boldsymbol{\varphi}$, denoted $\mathbf{M}^{\partial \mathcal{E} \mapsto \mathcal{E}} = \mathbf{J}^{-1} \bar{\mathbf{J}} : \mathbb{R}^{N^{\partial \mathcal{E}}_{bf}} \mapsto \mathbb{R}^{N^{\mathcal{E}}_{bf}}$. This mapping may be utilized to define the shape functions in a recursive fashion (over the children of each sub-element, in succession), ultimately yielding a representation for the shape functions on $\mathcal{E}$ in terms of only nodal evaluations $\varphi|_{V}$. This process is discussed in greater detail in the following section.
	
\subsection*{Hierarchial Construction of Shape Functions}

	For a given polyhedral element $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, we presume that each shape function $\varphi_A$ is associated with a particular node $V_A$ of the element, such that
	\begin{equation}
		\varphi_A |_{V_B} = \delta_{AB} \quad \forall A, \, B = 1, \ldots, N_V.
	\end{equation}
	
	Additionally, for the sake of simplicity (and computational efficiency), it is suggested that the shape functions along each linear edge $E$ be constructed from the Lagrange polynomials which interpolate the nodal values of that edge, i.e.
	\begin{equation}
		\varphi_A |_{E} (\mathbf{X}) = \sum_{b = 1}^{N^E_V} \psi_b (\mathbf{X}) \, \varphi_A |_{V_b}.
	\end{equation}

	For each polygonal face $F$, linear mappings $\mathbf{M}^{\partial F \mapsto F} : \mathbb{R}^{N^{F}_{V}} \mapsto \mathbb{R}^{N^{F}_{bf}}$ may be constructed according to the process described in the previous section, yielding 
	\begin{equation}
		\varphi_A |_{F} (\mathbf{X}) = \sum_{b = 1}^{N^F_{bf}} \sum_{c = 1}^{N^F_{V}} \psi_b (\mathbf{X}) \, M^{\partial F \mapsto F}_{bc} \varphi_A |_{V_c}.
	\end{equation}

	Subsequently, a mapping $\mathbf{M}^{\partial \Omega \mapsto \Omega} : \mathbb{R}^{N^{\partial \Omega}_{bf}} \mapsto \mathbb{R}^{N^{\Omega}_{bf}}$ is constructed to determine the representation for the shape functions on the interior of the element, which may be composed with the mappings $\mathbf{M}^{\partial F \mapsto F}$ for each face to determine a final mapping $\mathbf{M}^{V \mapsto \Omega} : \mathbb{R}^{N^{\Omega}_{V}} \mapsto \mathbb{R}^{N^{\Omega}_{bf}}$ which yields
	\begin{equation}
		\varphi_A |_{\Omega} (\mathbf{X}) = \sum_{b = 1}^{N^\Omega_{bf}} \sum_{c = 1}^{N^\Omega_{V}} \psi_b (\mathbf{X}) \, M^{V \mapsto \Omega}_{bc} \varphi_A |_{V_c}.
	\end{equation}

	Once the above representations for the element's have been obtained, the discrete data for the element (evaluations of the shape functions and their gradients at a discrete number of quadrature points $\left\{ \mathbf{X}_q \right\}_{q=1}^{N_{qp}}$ can be obtained directly from
	\begin{equation}
		\varphi_A |_{\Omega} (\mathbf{X}_q) = \sum_{b = 1}^{N^\Omega_{bf}} \sum_{c = 1}^{N^\Omega_{V}} \psi_b (\mathbf{X}_q) \, M^{V \mapsto \Omega}_{bc} \varphi_A |_{V_c},
	\end{equation}
	and
	\begin{equation}
		\nabla \varphi_A |_{\Omega} (\mathbf{X}_q) = \sum_{b = 1}^{N^\Omega_{bf}} \sum_{c = 1}^{N^\Omega_{V}} \nabla \psi_b (\mathbf{X}_q) \, M^{V \mapsto \Omega}_{bc} \varphi_A |_{V_c}.
	\end{equation}
	Once the discrete quadrature point evaluations for the shape functions have been obtained, there is no need to retain any information regarding the DG-PEM basis functions, or the transitional mappings; these objects and their corresponding data structures may therefore be discarded.

	The specification of the element's quadrature rule is discussed in the following section.

\subsection*{Construction of Quadrature Rules}

	The quadrature rule for an element $\left\{ \mathbf{X}_q, \, w_q \right\}_{q=1}^{N_{qp}}$ nominally consists of quadrature points $\mathbf{X}_q$ located at the centroids of each cell $\omega \in \mathcal{T}_\omega (\Omega)$, whose corresponding quadrature weights $w_q$ are equal to the volumes of each respective cell $|\omega|$. This results in the composite mid-point rule discussed in chapter \ref{ch:pem}.

	As presviously discussed, the volumes $|\omega|$ and centroids $\bar{\mathbf{X}}_\omega$ of each cell may be obtained via the exact integration formulas provided by Chin et al. in \cite{Chin:15}. Alternatively, we may exploit the geometric simplicity of the chosen edge-based partitioning to compute these quantities more easily, by considering the fact that each edge-centered cell $\omega$ consists of two tetrahedral sub-domains (i.e. $T_1 \cup T_2 = \omega$). Volumes and centroids for each tetrahedron can be easily computed using standard formulas, and the resulting quantities of interest may be expressed as
	\begin{equation}
		|\omega| = |T_1| + |T_2|, \quad \bar{\mathbf{X}}_\omega = \frac{|T_1| \bar{\mathbf{X}}_{T_1} + |T_2| \bar{\mathbf{X}}_{T_2}}{|\omega|}.
	\end{equation}

	Straightforward integration rules $\left\{ \mathbf{X}_q, \, w_q \right\}_{q=1}^{N^F_{qp}}$ for each face $F \subset \partial \Omega$ are more more easily obtained by considering the corresponding areas $|\sigma|$ and centroids $\bar{\mathbf{X}}_\sigma$ of each (strictly triangular) facet $\sigma \in \mathcal{T}_{\sigma} (F)$. Outward unit normals $\mathbf{N}_\sigma$ to each facet may also be readily computed and stored, as needed.

	With these quantities in hand, the element's shape functions (and their gradients) may be evaluated at the quadrature points of the element and it's faces. Subsequently, a consistent integration scheme (as discussed in \ref{ch:pem}) may be constructed from the discrete data stored at the element's quadrature points. If a gradient correction scheme is adopted, the corrected test function gradients $\nabla \phi_A (\mathbf{X}_q)$ at all quadrature points may be computed and stored according to the methodology previously described.

\section{Numerical Conditioning of the \\ DG-PEM Systems of Equations}

As a representative example, consider a given sub-element $\mathcal{E} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ and its corresponding partition into $d-$dimensional entities $\varepsilon \subset \mathcal{T}_\varepsilon (\mathcal{E})$. Recall that the representation of a given shape function $\varphi \in \mathcal{U}^h (\mathcal{E})$ is piecewise polynomial in each entity, i.e. $\varphi|_{\varepsilon} \in P^k (\varepsilon)$.

A reasonable estimate for the condition number $\kappa (\mathbf{J})$ of the SPD matrix $\mathbf{J}$ appearing in (\ref{eq:dgpem_linear_system}) may be obtained via
\begin{equation}
	 \frac{\max_a |J^{\varepsilon}_{aa}|}{\min_a |J^{\varepsilon}_{aa}|} \leq \kappa (\mathbf{J}),
\end{equation}
where
\begin{align}
	J^{\varepsilon}_{aa} = & \int_{\varepsilon} \nabla \psi^{\varepsilon}_{a} \, \cdot \nabla \psi^{\varepsilon}_{a} \, d \varepsilon + (\epsilon-1) \sum_{\zeta \in \partial \varepsilon \cap \partial \mathcal{E}} \int_{\zeta} \left( \psi^{\varepsilon}_a \right) \left( \mathbf{N}_{\zeta} \cdot \nabla \psi^{\varepsilon}_a \right) \, d \zeta \nonumber \\ 
	+ & \frac{1}{2} (\epsilon-1) \sum_{\zeta \in \partial \varepsilon \cap \Gamma_\varepsilon} \int_{\zeta} \left( \psi^{\varepsilon}_a \right) \left( \mathbf{N}_{\zeta} \cdot \nabla \psi^{\varepsilon}_a \right) \, d \zeta \nonumber \\
	+ & \sum_{\zeta \in \partial \varepsilon} \frac{\alpha_{\zeta0}}{|\zeta|^{\beta_0}} \int_{\zeta} \left( \psi_a^{\varepsilon} \right)^2 \, d \zeta + \sum_{\zeta \in \partial \varepsilon \cap \Gamma_\varepsilon} \frac{\alpha_{\zeta1}}{|\zeta|^{\beta_1}} \int_{\zeta} \left( \mathbf{N}_{\zeta} \cdot \nabla \psi^{\varepsilon}_a \right)^2 \, d \zeta.
\end{align}
A brief remark should be made regarding the positivity of $J^\varepsilon_{aa}$, and its relation to the particular choice of DG method (i.e. whether the SIPG, NIPG, or IIPG is chosen). As discussed in \cite{Riviere:08}, the NIPG method with $\epsilon = +1$ will yield strictly positive diagonal entries provided $\alpha_{\zeta0} > 0$, resulting in the coercivity of $\mathbf{J}$. If the SIPG ($\epsilon = -1$) or IIPG ($\epsilon = 0$) methods are employed, then the penalty parameters must be made sufficiently large enough to guarantee coercivity, stability.

The subsequent discussion examines the case where $\epsilon = +1$, yielding:
\begin{equation}
	J^{\varepsilon}_{aa} = \int_{\varepsilon} \nabla \psi^{\varepsilon}_{a} \, \cdot \nabla \psi^{\varepsilon}_{a} \, d \varepsilon + \sum_{\zeta \in \partial \varepsilon} \frac{\alpha_{\zeta0}}{|\zeta|^{\beta_0}} \int_{\zeta} \left( \psi_a^{\varepsilon} \right)^2 \, d \zeta + \sum_{\zeta \in \partial \varepsilon \cap \Gamma_\varepsilon} \frac{\alpha_{\zeta1}}{|\zeta|^{\beta_1}} \int_{\zeta} \left( \mathbf{N}_{\zeta} \cdot \nabla \psi^{\varepsilon}_a \right)^2 \, d \zeta.
\end{equation}
Let $h_{\varepsilon}$ denote the diameter of $\varepsilon$, such that
\begin{equation}
	h_{\varepsilon} = \sup_{\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{Y} \in \varepsilon} ||\mathbf{X} - \mathbf{Y}||_2.
\end{equation}
Using the following trace inequalities:
\begin{equation}
	\int_{\zeta} \left( \psi_a^{\varepsilon} \right)^2 \, d \zeta \leq C h_\varepsilon^{-1/2} \int_{\varepsilon} \left( \psi_a^{\varepsilon} \right)^2 \, d \varepsilon \quad \forall \zeta \subset \partial \varepsilon,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\int_{\zeta} \left( \mathbf{N}_{\zeta} \cdot \nabla \psi^{\varepsilon}_a \right)^2 \, d \zeta \leq C h_\varepsilon^{-1/2} \int_{\varepsilon} \nabla \psi^{\varepsilon}_{a} \, \cdot \nabla \psi^{\varepsilon}_{a} \, d \varepsilon \quad \forall \zeta \subset \partial \varepsilon,
\end{equation}
and observing $|\zeta|^{\beta_0} \leq h_\varepsilon$, $|\zeta|^{\beta_1} \geq h_\varepsilon^{-1}$ if $\beta_0 = (d-1)^{-1}$, $\beta_1 = -(d-1)^{-1}$ (assuming $h_\varepsilon \geq 1$, without loss of generality), then
\begin{equation}
	J^{\varepsilon}_{aa} \leq (1 + C_1 h_\varepsilon^{1/2}) \int_{\varepsilon} \nabla \psi^{\varepsilon}_{a} \, \cdot \nabla \psi^{\varepsilon}_{a} \, d \varepsilon + C_2 h_\varepsilon^{-3/2} \int_{\varepsilon} \left( \psi_a^{\varepsilon} \right)^2 \, d \varepsilon.
\end{equation}

If $\varphi|_{\varepsilon}$ is represented in terms of the (unshifted and unscaled) monomial basis (i.e. $\left\{ \varphi_a^\varepsilon \right\}_{a=1}^{N^\varepsilon_{bf}} = \left\{ \mathbf{X}^\alpha \right\}_{|\alpha| \leq k}$), then by application of the min-max inequality:
\begin{equation}
	\int_{\varepsilon} \mathbf{X}^{2\alpha} \, d \varepsilon \leq h_{\varepsilon}^d \max_{\mathbf{X} \in \varepsilon} \left\{ \mathbf{X}^{2\alpha} \right\} \leq h_{\varepsilon}^d R_{\varepsilon}^{2|\alpha|},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\int_{\varepsilon} \nabla \mathbf{X}^{\alpha} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{X}^{\alpha} \, d \varepsilon \leq h_{\varepsilon}^d \max_{\mathbf{X} \in \varepsilon} \left\{ \nabla \mathbf{X}^{\alpha} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{X}^{\alpha} \right\} \leq h_{\varepsilon}^d R_{\varepsilon}^{2\langle|\alpha|-1\rangle},
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
	R_\varepsilon = \max_{\mathbf{X} \in \varepsilon} || \mathbf{X} ||_2.
\end{equation}
Without loss of generality, if $R_\varepsilon \geq 1$, it becomes clear that
\begin{equation}
	C \left[ (h_\varepsilon^{d} + C_1 h_\varepsilon^{d+1/2}) + C_2 h_\varepsilon^{d-3/2} \right] \leq J^{\varepsilon}_{aa} \leq (h_\varepsilon^{d} + C_1 h_\varepsilon^{d+1/2}) R_{\varepsilon}^{2\langle k-1 \rangle} + C_2 h_\varepsilon^{d-3/2} R_{\varepsilon}^{2k}.
\end{equation}
If the penalty parameter $\alpha_{\gamma0}$ is sufficiently small, we obtain the estimate $\kappa (\mathbf{J}) \approx O(R_{\max}^{2\langle k-1 \rangle})$, where $R_{\max} = \max_{\varepsilon \in \mathcal{E}} R_\varepsilon$. Otherwise, if $\alpha_{\gamma0}$ is sufficiently large, then $\kappa (\mathbf{J}) \approx O(R_{\max}^{2k})$; a similar estimate may be obtained for the SIPG and IIPG methods.

Clearly, the condition number of $\mathbf{J}$ under these circumstances may become unacceptably large for increasing values of $k$ and $R_{\max}$, leading to numerical inaccuracies in the resulting shape functions, which ultimately degrades the degree of precision by which finite element patch tests are satisfied.

To mitigate this issue, the (sub-)element's shape functions may be computed with respect to a shifted and scaled coordinate system, i.e. $\mathbf{X}' = h_\mathcal{E}^{-1} (\mathbf{X} - \bar{\mathbf{X}}^{\mathcal{E}}_0)$. This assists in limiting the worst-case value of $R_{\max}$ appearing in the previous estimate, yielding a somewhat improved bound on the condition number: $\kappa (\mathbf{J}) \approx O(\rho^{2k})$, where $\rho = h_{\mathcal{E}} / h_{\min}$, and where
\begin{equation}
	h_{\min} = \inf_{\varepsilon \in \mathcal{T}_\varepsilon (\mathcal{E})} \sup_{B_r (\mathbf{X}_B) \subset \varepsilon} |2r|
\end{equation}
denotes the smallest diameter of the largest closed ball $B_r (\mathbf{X}_B) = \left\{ \mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^d : ||\mathbf{X} - \mathbf{X}_B||_2 \leq r \right\}$ fully contained within any single entity $\varepsilon \in \mathcal{T}_\varepsilon (\mathcal{E})$. Nonetheless, the condition number of $\mathbf{J}$ can become large if: a relatively refined partition of the element is utilized; if the aspect ratio of the element becomes large; or if the element's partition contains ``sliver cells'' (i.e. if an edge-based partition is employed on an element with nearly degenerate geometric features -- short edges.)

Significant improvements in obtaining more well-conditioned systems can be had by considering the DG basis described in \cite{Bassi:12}.

Further, consider an individual interface $\zeta$ which separates two entities, $\varepsilon_{1}$ and $\varepsilon_{2}$. Note that
\begin{equation}
        \int_{\zeta} [\![ \varphi ]\!]^2 \, ds = (\mathbf{c}^{\varepsilon_{1}} - \mathbf{c}^{\varepsilon_{2}}) \cdot \left[ \int_{\zeta} \mathbf{m} \otimes \mathbf{m} \, d \zeta \right] (\mathbf{c}^{\varepsilon_{1}} - \mathbf{c}^{\varepsilon_{2}}),
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
        h_b^2 \int_{\zeta} [\![ \mathbf{N} \cdot \nabla \varphi ]\!]^2 \, d \zeta = (\mathbf{c}^{\varepsilon_{1}} - \mathbf{c}^{\varepsilon_{2}}) \cdot \left[ h_b^2 \int_{\zeta} \frac{\partial \mathbf{m}}{\partial N} \otimes \frac{\partial \mathbf{m}}{\partial N} \, d \zeta \right] (\mathbf{c}^{\varepsilon_{1}} - \mathbf{c}^{\varepsilon_{2}}),
\end{equation}
where we prescribe $h_b = (|\sigma_{b1}| + |\sigma_{b2}|)/|\gamma_{b}|$ to obtain a proportional scaling of the two integral contributions to $\mathcal{G}$. If we define moment matrices $\mathbf{M}_{0b}$ and $\mathbf{M}_{1b}$ as
\begin{equation}
        \mathbf{M}_{0b} \equiv \int_{\gamma_b} \mathbf{m} \otimes \mathbf{m} \, ds
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
        \mathbf{M}_{1b} \equiv h_b^2 \int_{\gamma_b} \frac{\partial \mathbf{m}}{\partial n} \otimes \frac{\partial \mathbf{m}}{\partial n} \, ds
\end{equation}
then we may express the local contribution from segment $\gamma_b$ to $\mathcal{G}$ as
\begin{equation}
        \mathcal{G}_b = \frac{1}{2} \left\{ \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{a}_{\sigma_{b1}} \\ \mathbf{a}_{\sigma_{b2}} \end{array} \right\} \cdot \bigg( \beta_0 \left[ \begin{array}{cc} \mathbf{M}_{0b} & - \mathbf{M}_{0b} \\ - \mathbf{M}_{0b} & \mathbf{M}_{0b} \end{array} \right] + \beta_1 \left[ \begin{array}{cc} \mathbf{M}_{1b} & - \mathbf{M}_{1b} \\ - \mathbf{M}_{1b} & \mathbf{M}_{1b} \end{array} \right] \bigg) \left\{ \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{a}_{\sigma_{b1}} \\ \mathbf{a}_{\sigma_{b2}} \end{array} \right\},
\end{equation}
or more concisely:
\begin{equation}
        \mathcal{G}_b = \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{a}_{\sigma_{b_{1,2}}} \cdot \mathbf{J}_b \mathbf{a}_{\sigma_{b_{1,2}}}.
\end{equation}
The matrix $\mathbf{J}_b$ expressed in the above equation constitutes a local contribution from segment $\gamma_b$ to the Jacobian of $\partial \mathcal{G} / \partial \mathbf{a}_{\sigma_c}$ (i.e. to $\mathbf{J} = \partial^2 \mathcal{G} / \partial \mathbf{a}_{\sigma_c} \partial \mathbf{a}_{\sigma_d}$, which will ultimately be inverted when we solve for the unknown monomial coefficients in each cell). Consequently, it becomes of interest to investigate the condition number for the Jacobian of $\partial \mathcal{G} / \partial \mathbf{a}_{\sigma_c}$ in terms of our choice of polynomial basis.

We proceed in obtaining a rough approximation to $\kappa (\mathbf{J})$ by examining a particular element whose partition contains only one cell $\sigma$. For this simple case, we have
\begin{equation}
        \mathbf{J} = \beta_0 \int_{\partial \sigma} \mathbf{m} \otimes \mathbf{m} \, ds = \beta_0 \sum_{\forall b} \mathbf{M}_{0b}.
\end{equation}
Let us approximate the bounds for each monomial integral. By application of the triangle inequality to the Riemann integral of the monomials over $\partial \sigma$, we obtain
\begin{equation}
       \bigg| \int_{\partial \sigma} m_i m_j \, ds \bigg| \leq \int_{\partial \sigma} | m_i m_j | \, ds,
\end{equation}
and by the max-min inequality, we find
\begin{equation}
       \int_{\partial \sigma} | m_i m_j | \, ds \leq \max_{\mathbf{x} \in \partial \sigma} \{ | m_i m_j | \} \int_{\partial \sigma} \, ds.
\end{equation}
Since the monomials are continuous functions on $\partial \sigma$, by the mean-value theorem we have
\begin{equation}
        m^*_i m^*_j \int_{\partial \sigma} \, ds = \int_{\partial \sigma} m_i m_j \, ds
\end{equation}
and by extension
\begin{equation}
        | m^*_i m^*_j | \int_{\partial \sigma} \, ds = \bigg| \int_{\partial \sigma} m_i m_j \, ds \bigg|
\end{equation}
for some $m^*_i m^*_j$ evaluated at a particular $\mathbf{x}^* \in \partial \sigma$. By the extreme value theorem and the continuity of $|m_i m_j|$,
\begin{equation}
         \min_{\mathbf{x} \in \partial \sigma} \{ | m_i m_j | \} \leq | m^*_i m^*_j | \leq \max_{\mathbf{x} \in \partial \sigma} \{ | m_i m_j | \}.
\end{equation}
Therefore,
\begin{equation}
         \min_{\mathbf{x} \in \partial \sigma} \{ | m_i m_j | \} \int_{\partial \sigma} \, ds \leq | m^*_i m^*_j | \int_{\partial \sigma} \, ds = \bigg| \int_{\partial \sigma} m_i m_j \, ds \bigg|,
\end{equation}
and our bounds are thus,
\begin{equation}
       \min_{\mathbf{x} \in \partial \sigma} \{ | m_i m_j | \} \int_{\partial \sigma} \, ds \leq \bigg| \int_{\partial \sigma} m_i m_j \, ds \bigg| \leq \max_{\mathbf{x} \in \partial \sigma} \{ | m_i m_j | \} \int_{\partial \sigma} \, ds.
\end{equation}
These bounds are approximate, and in particular, the lower bound may be equal to zero in some cases. For our analysis of the condition number, these bounds prove to be insufficient. Indeed, the monomials of odd degree may well be equal to zero, but those of even degree are guaranteed to be non-zero for any cell $\sigma$ with finite area. It suffices to consider the projection $\mathcal{P} (\sigma)$ of the domain of $\sigma$ onto any linear subspace of dimension $1$ which yields a characteristic minimum dimension $d_{\min}$:
\begin{equation}
	d_{\min} = \inf_{\mathcal{P} (\sigma)} \{ \sup_{x, y \in \mathcal{P} (\sigma)} \{ | x - y | \} \}.
\end{equation}
Intuitively, $d_{\min}$ is the smallest possible dimension of any bounding box which contains $\sigma$. It is not difficult to see that the integral of any monomial of even degree $2p$ will be bounded from below by a finite term of order $O(d_{\min}^{2p})$. This remark will find significance later on.

Returning to the Jacobian $\mathbf{J}$, its entries $J_{ij}$ correspond to
\begin{equation}
        J_{ij} = \beta_0 \int_{\partial \sigma} m_i m_j \, ds.
\end{equation}
By Gershgorin's theorem, we may determine approximate bounds for every eigenvalue $\lambda$ of $\mathbf{J}$, such that
\begin{equation}
        | \lambda - J_{ii} | \leq \sum_{j \neq i} | J_{ij} | \quad \forall i,
\end{equation}
and consequently
\begin{equation}
        c_i - d_i \leq \lambda \leq c_i + d_i \quad \forall i,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
        c_i = \beta_0 \int_{\partial \sigma} m_i m_i \, ds,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
        d_i = \sum_{j \neq i} \bigg| \beta_0 \int_{\partial \sigma} m_i m_j \, ds \bigg|.
\end{equation}
The condition number of $\mathbf{J}$ is then bounded by
\begin{equation}
        \kappa (\mathbf{J}) \leq \frac{\max_i \{ | c_i + d_i | \}}{\min_i \{ | c_i - d_i | \}}.
\end{equation}
By the triangle inequality
\begin{equation}
        | c_i + d_i | \leq | c_i | + | d_i | = \sum_{j} \bigg| \beta_0 \int_{\partial \sigma} m_i m_j \, ds \bigg|,
\end{equation}
such that
\begin{equation}
        \kappa (\mathbf{J}) \leq \frac{\max_i \{ | c_i + d_i | \}}{\min_i \{ | c_i - d_i | \}} \leq \frac{\max_i \{ | c_i | + | d_i | \}}{\min_i \{ | c_i - d_i |  \}}.
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
        \max_i \{ | c_i | + | d_i | \} = \max_i \left\{ \sum_{j} \bigg| \beta_0 \int_{\partial \sigma} m_i m_j \, ds \bigg| \right\}.
\end{equation}
Provided $\beta_0 > 0$,
\begin{equation}
        \max_i \{ | c_i | + | d_i | \} \leq \beta_0 \max_i \left\{ \sum_{j} \max_{\mathbf{x} \in \partial \sigma} \{ | m_i m_j | \} \right\} \int_{\partial \sigma} \, ds.
\end{equation}
Since $\mathbf{J}$ is assumed to be positive definite, $c_i > 0$ and $c_i - | d_i | > 0$, and we may write (approximately)
\begin{equation}
        \min_i \{ | c_i  - d_i | \} \approx \min_i \{ | c_i | \} \geq \beta_0 \min_i \left\{ \beta_0 \int_{\partial \sigma} m_i m_i \, ds \right\}.
\end{equation}

Suppose there exist some maximum and minimum radii $r_{\max}$ and $r_{\min}$ such that $r_{\min} \leq || \mathbf{x} ||_2 \leq r_{\max} \, \forall \mathbf{x} \in \partial \sigma$ and  $r_{\max} > r_{\min} \geq 0$. Note that if $r_{\max} > 1$, then
\begin{equation}
        \max_i \left\{ \sum_{j} \max_{\mathbf{x} \in \partial \sigma} \{ | m_i m_j | \} \right\} = O (r_{\max}^{2k}),
\end{equation}
and if $r_{\max} < 1$, then
\begin{equation}
        \max_i \left\{ \sum_{j} \max_{\mathbf{x} \in \partial \sigma} \{ | m_i m_j | \} \right\} = O (1).
\end{equation}
Separately, if $r_{\min} > 1$, then
\begin{equation}
        \min_i \left\{ \int_{\partial \sigma} m_i m_i \, ds \right\} \geq \min_i \left\{ \min_{\mathbf{x} \in \partial \sigma} \{ | m_i m_i | \} \right\} \int_{\partial \sigma} \, ds = O (1),
\end{equation}
and if $r_{\min} < 1$, then
\begin{equation}
         \min_i \left\{ \int_{\partial \sigma} m_i m_i \, ds \right\} \geq \min_i \left\{ \min_{\mathbf{x} \in \partial \sigma} \{ | m_i m_i | \} \right\} \int_{\partial \sigma} \, ds = O (r_{\min}^{-2k}).
\end{equation}
If $r_{\min} = 0$ (or when $d_{\min} > 2r_{\min}$), we invoke our alternative lower bound for the monomial integrals of even degree, such that
\begin{equation}
         \min_i \left\{ \int_{\partial \sigma} m_i m_i \, ds \right\} = O (d_{\min}^{-2k}).
\end{equation}
Now, define a characteristic dimension $h$ satisfying
\begin{equation}
        h = \frac{\max \{ r_{\max}, \, 1 \}}{\min \{ \max \{d_{\min}/2, \, r_{\min} \}, \, 1 \}}.
\end{equation}
The approximate condition number of $\mathbf{J}$ for a given cell $\sigma$ with characteristic dimension $h$ using a monomial basis up to order $k$ is then
\begin{equation}
        \kappa (\mathbf{J}) \approx O(h^{2k}).
	\label{eq:estimate}
\end{equation}

Following a number of numerical experiments, it was determined that the estimate in (\ref{eq:estimate}) is quite accurate, and illuminates a number of key points:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[(I.)] The condition number depends upon the dimensions of the element, and more specifically, upon the dimensions of its partition.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[a.] Isotropically scaling an element will change the condition number of the resulting PEM linear systems, for better or for worse. This would seem to justify the idea of rescaling PEM elements into a corresponding ``parent'' domain -- ideally one which minimizes $h$. Shape functions and gradients would then be computed in the parent configuration, and subsequently mapped back into the element's physical configuration.
		\item[b.] Choosing the element's reference coordinate system poorly may subtly impact the conditioning of the PEM linear systems. This further justifies the idea that the element's local coordinate system should be shifted in such a way as to minimize $h$. However, certain choices of reference coordinate may be preferable/optimal for the different tope-level minimum problems. Namely, recent numerical experiments have revealed that the solution inaccuracies caused by nearly planar faces can be effectively mitigated when the element's reference coordinate is chosen to lie on or near the warped face(s). This finding may warrant the reconsideration of a local coordinate system being used for every cell (or at the very least, for every tope) of the element.
		\item[c.] Elements with unequal dimensions (i.e. thin elements) will unavoidably suffer from issues of poor conditioning due to a larger relative value of $h$ (regardless of isotropic scaling). The natural temptation would be to scale the element anisotropically in an effort to achieve better conditioning. However, this would need to be done with care; every tope of the element would need to be scaled independently, according to a given tope's dimensions alone. This condition is necessary to guarantee inter-face compatibility between elements, as two anisotropically scaled elements would not, in general, produce identical shape functions on their shared face.
	\end{itemize}
	\item[(II.)] The condition number becomes drastically worse when higher order monomials are used.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[a.] This explains a great deal about why the quadratic PEM elements have performed so poorly in convergence studies up to this point: not only does $h$ become worse under mesh refinement, but the condition number scales as $O(h^4)$ for quadratic elements, leading to significant inaccuracies in the shape function computations, and subsequent losses in solution accuracy.
		\item[b.] Unfortunately, this makes thin quadratic elements even more sensitive to the relative scaling of $h$. It is unclear whether or not anisotropically rescaling the elements will sufficiently improve matters.
	\end{itemize}
	\item[(III.)] Perhaps most importantly: the strong dependence of the condition number upon $h$ and $k$ is largely a consequence of our specific choice of polynomial basis (i.e. the monomial basis).
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[a.] Because the solution unknowns that we seek are monomial coefficients, it is to be expected that the constant, gradient (and curvature) coefficients may differ by orders of magnitude, depending on the relative scale of the element in physical space.
		\item[b.] A more robust solution to the aforementioned issues of conditioning might be obtained through the selection of a different polynomial basis for $P_k (\Omega)$ (other than the monomial basis). In particular, the use of an orthonormal polynomial basis (with respect to an appropriately defined norm on an arbitrary element domain) could entirely circumvent the problem of poor conditioning. To prove this, we would need to illustrate that the resulting condition number of $\mathbf{J}$ using an orthonormal polynomial basis is less sensitive to both $h$ and $k$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
