Baldwin - Continuum Mechanics Problem Statement
		simply states the continuum mechanics problem in the span of just 2 pages!
Emerson - No mention of solid mechanics, but provides framework for other stuff
Gullet - Overview of Galerkin methods
		-Governing equations: jumps straight to Strong form, then Weak form
		-Galerkin method: consider subspace approx, Convergence, FEM, Meshless methods, VETFEM
Selimotic - Finite element formulation
		-Continuum Mechanics BVP formulation: strong form
		-Weak form & discretization
		-Conventional FEM & Galerkin approach
		-Main characteristics and constraints of the conventional FEM
		-Intro to VETFEM
Settgast - Finite element preliminaries
		-FEM equations of motion: strong to weak in 2 pages
		-time stepping
		-Element formulation
		-Kinematics for constitutive input
Wopschall - Notational and Mathematical Preliminaries
	  - Introduction to nonlinear Solid Mechanics
	  - Finite element Formulation in Nonlinear solid mechanics
	  - Nonlinear solution strategies
		(probably all of this goes into excessive detail; don't really need all this

CORE IDEA: focus on what YOU did; don't explain foundational elements. Only bring these up if relevant
