%
This chapter defines a general class of polytopal element formulations referred to as partitioned element methods (PEM). The essential characteristics and mathematical requirements placed upon these methods are formally stated, giving rise to a family of different approaches, for which some formal investigations are conducted. Several specific formulations are summarized in detail, and a number of existing methods are herein classified as particular instances of partitioned element methods.

Partitioned element methods are finite element-like methods which approach the task of constructing shape functions on arbitrary polytopal element domains by partitioning each element into sub-domains (quadrature cells). The element partition serves a dual purpose: it is used to establish a composite quadrature rule for the element, and to define a finite dimensional function space, from which the element's shape functions are selected as the solutions to corresponding boundary value problems defined locally on the element.

	% want efficient and stable quadrature rules
Partitioned element methods are motivated by the idea that it is generally easier and more efficient to define complicated functions over arbitrary domains if the functions are defined in a piece-wise polynomial fashion over simpler sub-domains. This is precisely the mentality which likewise motivates the finite element method. The PEM is driven by the need for establishing stable and efficient quadrature rules on arbitrary polytopes. Unlike virtual element methods which typically circumvent the use of quadrature altogether, partitioned element methods recognize the necessity of using domain quadrature rules to evaluate nonlinear residual and stiffness contributions. The use of sufficient quadrature also yields a stable integration of the weak form which does not rely upon unphysical stabilization parameters.

	% depart from the idea of shape functions defined pointwise
In contrast with most traditional perspectives which regard the shape functions as being continuously defined on element domains (i.e. generalized barycentric coordinates), the PEM exploits the fact that the shape functions and their gradients only need to be evaluated at a discrete number of quadrature points. With this in mind, PEM approximation spaces are deliberately centered around the quadrature cell partition of the element, and consequently resemble finite element approximation spaces.

	% enforce constraints to attain reproducibility & consistency
The resulting shape functions on each element are altogether subject to the conditions of approximability, compatibility, stability, and quadrature consistency, as discussed in chapter \ref{ch:solid_mechanics}. Together, these conditions impose a number of unique requirements upon the element's partition, it's corresponding quadrature rules, and the associated cell-based approximation spaces.

In the following sections, an abstract framework for the PEM is established, describing the corresponding shape function boundary value problems defined on an element. We further enumerate several specific partitioned element methods, and provide an assessment of their potential strengths and weaknesses.

%PEM encompasses the special case where each element consists of a single sub-domain. Such approaches will henceforth be referred to as \textit{single-cell} methods, which share certain similarities with the VEM and VETFEM. Single-cell methods are not particularly robust when applied to arbitrary polyhedral meshes (namely those generated by B-rep intersection); they perform poorly if the element's geometry is sufficiently complicated.

\section{Definition of Element Shape Functions}

	Consider the structure of a polyhedral element $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^3$, as depicted in figure (N). The element's boundary $\partial \Omega$ may be subdivided into a set of polygonal faces $\mathcal{T}_F (\Omega) = \left\{ F_i \right\}_{i=1}^{N_F}$, such that each face $F_i$ is shared entirely with an adjacent element, or with the mesh boundary. Corresponding sets of linear edges $\mathcal{T}_E (\Omega) = \left\{ E_i \right\}_{i=1}^{N_E}$ and nodes $\mathcal{T}_V (\Omega) = \left\{ V_i \right\}_{i=1}^{N_V}$ result by considering the sets of all unique intersections $\mathcal{T}_E (\Omega) = \left\{ F_i \cap F_j \neq \emptyset \, \, \forall i \neq j \right\}$ and $\mathcal{T}_V (\Omega) = \left\{ E_i \cap E_j \neq \emptyset \, \, \forall i \neq j \right\}$, respectively.
	
	% PEM function spaces are broken $H^1 (\Omega)$ spaces
	% functions are defined independently on the open interior $\Omega$
	% functions defined independently on shared element interfaces
	The function spaces under consideration in the PEM are effectively broken $H^k (\Omega)$ spaces, where a given element shape function $\varphi \in \mathcal{W}_k (\overline{\Omega})$ is defined independently on the open interior of each polyhedral element $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^3$, and on its boundary $\partial \Omega$, such that
	\begin{equation}
		\mathcal{W}_k (\overline{\Omega}) = \left\{ \varphi|_{\Omega} \in H^k (\Omega) : \mathcal{L}_{\Omega} \varphi = f_{\Omega} \, \text{in} \, \Omega, \, \varphi|_{F} \in \mathcal{W}_k (\overline{F}) \, \, \forall F \in \partial \Omega \right\},
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}
		\mathcal{W}_k (\overline{F}) = \left\{ \varphi|_{F} \in H^k (F) : \mathcal{L}_{F} \varphi = f_{F} \, \text{in} \, F, \, \varphi|_{E} \in \mathcal{W}_k (\overline{E}) \, \, \forall E \in \partial F \right\},
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}
		\mathcal{W}_k (\overline{E}) = \left\{ \varphi|_{E} \in H^k (E) : \mathcal{L}_{E} \varphi = f_{E} \, \text{in} \, E, \, \varphi|_{V} \in \mathbb{R} \, \, \forall V \in \partial E \right\}.
	\end{equation}
	In essence, the PEM supposes that a given function $\varphi|_{\Omega} \in H^k (\Omega)$ defined on the element's interior is related to a corresponding boundary function $\varphi|_{\partial \Omega} = \bar{\varphi}$ (which itself is a broken $H^k (\partial \Omega)$ function) via a well-posed Dirichlet boundary value problem:
	\begin{equation}
		\mathcal{L}_{\Omega} \varphi = f_{\Omega} \quad \forall \mathbf{X} \in \Omega \quad \text{s.t.} \quad \varphi = \bar{\varphi} \quad \forall \mathbf{X} \in \partial \Omega,
		\label{eq:pem_bvp}
	\end{equation}
	where $\mathcal{L}_{\Omega}$ denotes a linear differential operator, and $f_{\Omega} \in L^2 (\Omega)$ is a generic forcing function. The element's degrees of freedom are collectively accounted for in both $\bar{\varphi}$ and $f_{\Omega}$. Consequently, the interior function $\varphi|_{\Omega}$ is uniquely defined, provided there exists a unique solution to (\ref{eq:pem_bvp}). In turn, we suppose that $\varphi|_{F} \in H^k(F)$ is the solution to a similar (2-dimensional) boundary value problem defined on each face $F$, and $\varphi|_E \in H^k(E)$ is the solution to a (1-dimensional) BVP on each edge $E$.
	
	% Additionally, the PEM considers the boundary of each element to be partitioned into a collection of $2$-dimensional polygonal faces $\partial \Omega = \cup_{i = 1}^{N_F} F_i$, where a given face $F$ is either a shared interface between two elements $F = \partial \Omega_a \cap \partial \Omega_b \neq \emptyset$ ($a \neq b$), or else it is a part of the domain boundary $F \subset \partial \Omega_a \cap \partial \mathcal{B}_0 \neq \emptyset$.
	% The boundary of each face $\partial F$ is likewise recursively partitioned into $1$-dimensional edges $\partial F = \cup_{i = 1}^{N_E} E_i$, whose end-points are the geometric verticies (the nodes) of the polyhedral element in question, which bear the primary degrees of freedom.
	
	The advantage of defining shape functions in this manner is that it affords a great deal of flexibility in the construction of arbitrary order interpolants, while maintaining $C^0$ continuity at inter-element interfaces. Moreover, given that the shape functions are uniquely defined at every point $\mathbf{X} \in \Omega$, they are amenable to post-processing and visualization-related tasks.
	
%	In the following sections, we will explore a few specific choices for the differential operator $\mathcal{L}$ and the forcing functions $f$ defined on the element and its faces, etc.

\subsection*{Harmonic Shape Functions}

	% Ideally want the shape functions to be uniquely defined on polytopes
	% This can be achieved by considering SFs as unique solutions to BVPs
	% Most natural BVP to consider is Laplace's equation with Dirichlet BCs
	% BCs arise from conditions of compatibility with nodal values
		% Help to guarantee weak inter-element compatibility
	% Other authors have explored the idea of harmonic SFs on polytopes
		% See \cite{Gordon:74}, \cite{Martin:08}, \cite{Bishop:14}
		% To obtain these SFs, the authors use an element partition
	% In previous works, the BCs were enforced as closely as possible
	% This is not necessarily a good thing
		% The solution to Laplace's equation can yield sharp gradients
		% On arbitrary domains, can result in poor conditioning, locking
	% In the present work, we seek to relax the conditions of compatibility
		% Consider weak compatibility requirements
			% Develop notion of weak compatibility in a rigorous setting
			% Establish weak compatibility as sufficient for convergence
			% Examine necessary conditions for stability
		% Yields a non-conforming finite element method
		% Elements are more robust on account of relaxed compatibility
		% Polytopes accomodate nonconformity better (than simplicies, etc)

	The simplest choice of $\mathcal{L}_{\Omega} = -\nabla^2$ and $f_{\Omega} = 0$ corresponds to Laplace's equation:
	\begin{equation}
		\nabla^2 \varphi = 0 \quad \forall \mathbf{X} \in \Omega \quad \text{s.t.} \quad \varphi = \bar{\varphi} \quad \forall \mathbf{X} \in \partial \Omega,
		\label{eq:pem_laplace}
	\end{equation}
	whose solution $\varphi$ is harmonic on $\Omega$ (and likewise on each face $F$ and edge $E$). Harmonic shape functions form a partition of unity, are linearly complete, and arise from degrees of freedom $\varphi|_V$ borne only by the nodes of each element (therefore, they satisfy the kronecker delta property.) As such, harmonic shape functions are classifiable under the category of generalized barycentric coordinates.
	
	If instead $f_{\Omega} \neq 0$ (corresponding to Poisson's equation), then
	\begin{equation}
		-\nabla^2 \varphi = f_{\Omega} \quad \forall \mathbf{X} \in \Omega \quad \text{s.t.} \quad \varphi = \bar{\varphi} \quad \forall \mathbf{X} \in \partial \Omega,
		\label{eq:pem_poisson}
	\end{equation}
	and we may introduce additional degrees of freedom through $f_{\Omega}$ belonging to edges, faces, or element domains. These degrees of freedom are not necessarily associated with nodal evaluations of $\varphi$, but instead may be designed to exhibit certain desirable characteristics (to recover a particular order of polynomial completeness). The solution $\varphi$ to (\ref{eq:pem_poisson}) is not harmonic; instead, we shall refer to such functions as \textit{generalized harmonic shape functions}.
	
	Harmonic shape functions are not a new concept; Gordon and Wixom were among the first authors to propose the idea in \cite{Gordon:74}, and Martin et al. later considered their application to polyhedral finite elements in \cite{Martin:08}. However, obtaining exact solutions to (\ref{eq:pem_laplace}) is generally infeasible for arbitrary polyhedra. In practice, approximate solutions must be considered.
	
	In particular, Bishop has proposed a method for constructing FE approximations to harmonic shape functions in \cite{Bishop:14}. Additionally, the VETFEM (\cite{Rashid:00}, \cite{Rashid:06}) and the original PEM presented in \cite{Rashid:12}, may be viewed as techniques for obtaining discrete approximations to harmonic shape functions. Likewise, many virtual element methods (\cite{Chi:17}, \cite{Veiga:13}, \cite{Veiga:15}) suppose that the element shape functions are harmonic over individual element domains, though they are never explicitly constructed or represented as such.
	
	It herein becomes of interest to determine suitable approximations to harmonic shape functions on arbitrary polyhedra. A number of methods to achieve this end are subsequently discussed.
	
\subsection*{Shape Function Approximation Methods}
	
	The exact solution $\varphi \in \mathcal{U} (\Omega) = \left\{ \varphi \in H^1(\Omega) : \varphi = \bar{\varphi} \, \forall \mathbf{X} \in \partial \Omega \right\}$ to (the more general) Poisson's equation in (\ref{eq:pem_poisson}) also satisfies the equivalent weak form:
	\begin{equation}
		\int_\Omega (\nabla^2 \varphi + f) \eta \, dV = 0 \quad \forall \eta \in \mathcal{U}_0 (\Omega),
	\end{equation}
	or
	\begin{equation}
		\int_\Omega \nabla \varphi \cdot \nabla \eta \, dV - \int_{\partial \Omega} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial N} \eta \, dA = \int_\Omega f \eta \, dV \quad \forall \eta \in \mathcal{U}_0 (\Omega),
		\label{eq:weak_bvp}
	\end{equation}
	where $\mathcal{U}_0 (\Omega) = \left\{ \eta \in H^1(\Omega) : \eta = 0 \, \forall \mathbf{X} \in \partial \Omega \right\}$ denotes an appropriately defined space of admissible variations -- test functions.
	
	A vast array of different variational methods may be employed to obtain an approximate solution $\varphi^h \in \mathcal{U}^h (\Omega)$ satisfying
	\begin{equation}
		\int_\Omega \nabla \varphi^h \cdot \nabla \eta^h \, dV - \int_{\partial \Omega} \frac{\partial \varphi^h}{\partial N} \eta^h \, dA = \int_\Omega f \eta^h \, dV \quad \forall \eta^h \in \mathcal{U}^h_0 (\Omega),
		\label{eq:approximate_bvp}
	\end{equation}
	where $\mathcal{U}^h (\Omega)$ and $\mathcal{U}^h_0 (\Omega)$ are taken to be finite-dimensional approximation spaces. Consequently, it is of interest to determine the minimum requirements placed upon a given approximation $\varphi^h$ for the purposes of evaluating weak form integrals.
	
	Specifically, for a finite element approximation to the model problem given in (\ref{eq:bilinear_form}), consider the evaluation of an element's local bilinear form $a_{\Omega}(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})$, where $\mathbf{u} = \sum_{a=1}^N \varphi_a \mathbf{u}_a$ and $\mathbf{v} = \sum_{a=1}^N \varphi_a \mathbf{v}_a$ are written in terms of the element's shape functions $\left\{ \varphi_a \right\}_{a=1}^N$. An approximate evaluation of $a_{\Omega}(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})$ is obtained via $a_{\Omega}(\mathbf{u}^h,\mathbf{v}^h)$, where $\mathbf{u}^h = \sum_{a=1}^N \varphi^h_a \mathbf{u}_a$ and $\mathbf{v}^h = \sum_{a=1}^N \varphi^h_a \mathbf{v}_a$ are instead represented in terms of the approximations $\left\{ \varphi^h_a \right\}_{a=1}^N$ to the element's shape functions.
	
	According to the virtual element decomposition proposed in \cite{Veiga:13}, we may express a given function $\mathbf{u} = \Pi \mathbf{u} + (\mathbf{u} - \Pi \mathbf{u})$ in terms of a low-order polynomial part $\Pi \mathbf{u}$ and a non-polynomial part $\mathbf{u} - \Pi \mathbf{u}$, where $\Pi$ is a corresponding polynomial projection operator satisfying $a_{\Omega}(\Pi \mathbf{u},\mathbf{v} - \Pi \mathbf{v}) = 0 \, \, \forall \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}$, and thus
	\begin{equation}
		a_{\Omega}(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}) = a_{\Omega}(\Pi \mathbf{u},\Pi \mathbf{v}) + a_{\Omega}(\mathbf{u} - \Pi \mathbf{u},\mathbf{v} - \Pi \mathbf{v}).
		\label{eq:vem_decomposition}
	\end{equation}
	The first term appearing in the right-hand side of (\ref{eq:vem_decomposition}) accounts for the consistency of the finite element approximation, whereas the second term provides stability. To maintain consistency, the first term must be computed exactly, to the extent that
	\begin{equation}
		a_{\Omega}(\Pi \mathbf{u},\Pi \mathbf{v}) = a_{\Omega}(\Pi \mathbf{u}^h,\Pi \mathbf{v}^h).
	\end{equation}	
	However, the second term need only be sufficiently well-approximated by
	\begin{equation}
		a_{\Omega}(\mathbf{u} - \Pi \mathbf{u},\mathbf{v} - \Pi \mathbf{v}) \approx a_{\Omega}(\mathbf{u}^h - \Pi \mathbf{u}^h,\mathbf{v}^h - \Pi \mathbf{v}^h),
	\end{equation}
	to the extent that the correct order of convergence is maintained, and the inf-sup condition is altogether satisfied. It is argued that these conditions are sufficient to guarantee convergence of the resulting method when the local approximations $\mathbf{u}^h$ and $\mathbf{v}^h$ are used in place of $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$.
	
	It should be remarked that the evaluation of $a_{\Omega}(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})$ will be further approximated through the use of numerical quadrature on $\Omega$, denoted by $a^h_{\Omega}(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})$. Incidentally, the use of low-order quadrature rules may alternatively be viewed as an exact integration of corresponding low-order approximations to $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$, i.e. $a^h_{\Omega}(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}) = a_{\Omega}(\mathbf{u}^h,\mathbf{v}^h)$, and subject to the conditions previously described.
	
	With the above considerations borne in mind, we propose a set of requirements on the approximation spaces $\mathcal{U}^h (\Omega)$ and $\mathcal{U}^h_0 (\Omega)$:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[(1)] If $\mathcal{U} (\Omega) \supset P^{k} (\Omega)$, then we require $\mathcal{U}^h (\Omega) \supset P^{k} (\Omega)$ to recover polynomial reproducibility of the shape functions up to order $k$.
		\item[(2)] If $u^h = \sum_{a=1}^N \varphi^h_a u_a$ represents an approximation to a scalar function defined on $\Omega$, then for the sake of stability we require that $C \int_{\Omega} (u^h)^2 \, dV > \sum_{a=1}^N u^2_a$ hold for some $C > 0$, where the integral over $\Omega$ is carried out using the element's quadrature rule.
		\item[(3)] We require that $\varphi^h \rightarrow \varphi$ in the limit as the dimensions of $\mathcal{U}^h (\Omega)$ and $\mathcal{U}^h_0 (\Omega)$ are systematically increased.
	\end{itemize}
	
\subsubsection*{Continuous Galerkin Approximations to Harmonic Shape Functions}

	Consider finite dimensional sub-spaces $\mathcal{U}^h (\Omega) \subset \mathcal{U} (\Omega)$ and $\mathcal{U}^h_0 (\Omega) \subset \mathcal{U}_0 (\Omega)$. The Galerkin approximation $\varphi^h \in \mathcal{U}^h (\Omega)$ to a given harmonic shape function $\varphi \in \mathcal{U} (\Omega)$ satisfies
	\begin{equation}
		\int_\Omega \nabla \varphi^h \cdot \nabla \eta^h \, dV = \int_\Omega f \eta^h \, dV \quad \forall \eta^h \in \mathcal{U}^h_0 (\Omega).
		\label{eq:weak_poisson}
	\end{equation}
	
	Bishop has already explored such an approximation scheme using an FE discretization of a given polyheral element into sub-dividing tetrahedra. The corresponding shape function approximations $\varphi^h$ are obtained as the solutions to a set of local finite element problems defined on $\Omega$. Moreover, it was demonstrated in \cite{Bishop:14} that the resulting approximations preserve low-order polynomial completeness. If the elements are sufficiently discretized into tetrahedra, the method is observed to be both stable and convergent (provided a gradient correction scheme is adopted to account for the effects of integration error).
	
	This approach can become computationally expensive if the elements are subdivided into a large number of tetrahedra, in an attempt to obtain more accurate approximations to the shape functions. However, initial numerical investigations have suggested that relatively coarse tetrahedral sub-divisions of the elements provide sufficiently accurate results; further subdivision does little to improve the overall accuracy of the method.
	
	A natural extension of the method proposed by Bishop to higher-order serendipity elements would be to consider subdividing the element domains into quadratic tetrahedra (or cubic tetrahedra, etc.) to recover the proper order of polynomial completeness. This unfortunately bears a higher computational cost per element with increasing polynomial degree, though the underlying tetrahedral subdivisions would remain the same. Figure (K) provides a depiction of what the proposed shape function approximations would look like for an arbitrary polygonal element.
	
	However, a particular complication arises for harmonic shape functions and their corresponding $C^0$ approximations under certain conditions: the solution to Laplace's equation may possess extremely sharp gradients if the geometry of the element contains reflex corners or nearly degenerate features (i.e. short edges). A consequence of this is poor conditioning of the element's local stiffness matrix, leading to excessively stiff modes of deformation (locking), and issues of numerical conditioning in the linear solution process. For this reason, it becomes of interest to consider non-conforming approximations $\varphi^h \in \mathcal{U}^h (\Omega) \not\subset \mathcal{U} (\Omega)$ which have the potential to overcome these issues.
	
\subsubsection*{Non-conforming Galerkin Approximations to Harmonic Shape Functions}

	If one should like to relax the strict enforcement of the boundary conditions imposed upon a given shape function to the extent that $\varphi^h \neq \bar{\varphi}$ on $\partial \Omega$, one observes that $\mathcal{U}^h (\Omega) \not\subset \mathcal{U} (\Omega)$, and one must resort to the use of a non-conforming approximation method.
	
	One approach would be to consider a Lagrange multiplier method to weakly enforce the boundary condition $\varphi = \bar{\varphi}$ on $\partial \Omega$ via
	\begin{equation}
		\min_{\varphi, \, \lambda} \mathcal{L}(\varphi,\lambda),
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{L}(\varphi,\lambda) \equiv \frac{1}{2} \int_{\Omega} \nabla \varphi \cdot \nabla \varphi \, dV - \int_{\Omega} f \varphi \, dV + \int_{\partial \Omega} \left[ \varphi - \bar{\varphi} \right] \lambda \, dA,
\end{equation}
	which involves the Lagrange multiplier field $\lambda \in \Lambda (\partial \Omega) = \left\{ \lambda \in L^2 (\partial \Omega) \right\}$. This yields two sets of equations in terms of the approximations $\varphi^h \in \mathcal{U}^h (\Omega)$ and $\lambda^h \in \Lambda^h (\partial \Omega) \subset \Lambda (\partial \Omega)$:
	\begin{equation}
		\int_{\Omega} \nabla \varphi^h \cdot \nabla \eta^h \, dV - \int_\Omega f \eta^h \, dV + \int_{\partial \Omega} \lambda^h \eta^h \, dA = 0 \quad \forall \eta^h \in \mathcal{U}^h (\Omega),
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}
		\int_{\partial \Omega} (\varphi^h - \bar{\varphi}) \, \mu^h \, dA = 0 \quad \forall \mu^h \in \Lambda^h (\partial \Omega).
	\end{equation}
	Suppose that we establish bases for $\varphi^h$ and $\lambda^h$:
\begin{equation}
	\varphi^h (\mathbf{X}) = \sum_{a=1}^{N} \psi_a (\mathbf{X}) \varphi_a, \quad \lambda^h (\mathbf{X}) = \sum_{a=1}^{M} \Psi_a (\mathbf{X}) \lambda_a,
\end{equation}
such that
\begin{equation}
	\sum_{a=1}^N \left[ \int_{\Omega} \nabla \varphi_a \cdot \nabla \varphi_b \, dV \right] u_a + \sum_{c=1}^M \left[ \int_{\partial \Omega} \varphi_b \, \phi_c \, dA \right] \lambda_c = 0 \quad \forall b,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\sum_{b=1}^N \left[ \int_{\partial \Omega} \phi_c \, \varphi_b \, dA \right] u_b = \int_{\partial \Omega} \bar{u} \, \phi_c \, dA \quad \forall c.
\end{equation}
If we suppose that the boundary conditions can be written in terms of yet another basis, i.e.
\begin{equation}
	\bar{u} = \sum_{a=1}^N \psi_a \bar{u}_a,
\end{equation}
then
\begin{equation}
	\sum_{b=1}^N \left[ \int_{\partial \Omega_e} \phi_c \, \varphi_b \, dA \right] u_b = \sum_{a=1}^M \left[ \int_{\partial \Omega_e} \psi_a \, \phi_c \, dA \right] \bar{u}_a \quad \forall c.
\end{equation}
Given an appropriate selection for the indicated bases, we must solve the saddle-point problem, in matrix format:
\begin{equation}
	\left[ \begin{array}{cc} \mathbf{K} & \mathbf{C} \\ \mathbf{C}^T & \mathbf{0} \end{array} \right] \left\{ \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{u} \\ \boldsymbol{\lambda} \end{array} \right\} = \left\{ \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{0} \\ \mathbf{B} \bar{\mathbf{u}} \end{array} \right\},
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
	K_{ab} = \int_{\Omega_e} \nabla_X \varphi_a \cdot \nabla_X \varphi_b \, dV, \quad C_{bc} = \int_{\partial \Omega_e} \varphi_b \, \phi_c \, dA, \quad B_{ac} = \int_{\partial \Omega_e} \psi_a \, \phi_c \, dA.
\end{equation}
	
\section{Break}
	
	Ultimately, one must show either that $\mathcal{S}^h$ and $\mathcal{V}^h$ and sub-spaces of $\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{V}$, or else that any exterior approximation methods converge to the exact solution under cell refinement. Moreover, we must show that any approximation to the exact solution will yield elements that exhibit convergence under mesh (element) refinement -- and interesting embedded convergence problem.
		
	% Present the BVP (Laplace's equation) for polytopes with BCs
	% Various methods have sought solutions to the above using FEM, etc.

Harmonic shape functions $\varphi$ satisfy the following partial differential equation on each polytopal element domain $\Omega_e$:
\begin{equation}
	\nabla^2_X \varphi = 0 \quad \forall \mathbf{X} \in \Omega_e,
\end{equation}
subject to the Dirichlet boundary conditions:
\begin{equation}
	\varphi = \bar{\varphi} \quad \forall \mathbf{X} \in \partial \Omega_e,
\end{equation}
where it is supposed that the boundary conditions are informed by the values of the shape functions defined at the elements' nodes. Harmonic shape functions which satisfy the above are uniquely defined, and possess a number of desirable properties: smoothness, $C^0$ continuity at element boundaries, partition of unity, and polynomial reproducibility.

The notion that the shape functions define a set of smooth and continuous interpolants on an element is an appealing concept, though it can frequently lead to numerical complications (nearly-singular solutions), particularly if the elements possess degenerate geometric features. Herein we postulate a number of alternative boundary value problems for constructing shape functions on arbitrary polytopes. These formulations are informed by the conditions of \textit{weak compatibility}, discussed in the following section.

An equivalent set of weakened boundary conditions may be written as
\begin{equation}
	\int_{\partial \Omega_e} \left[ u - \bar{u} \right] \lambda \, dA = 0 \quad \forall \lambda \in H^{1/2} (\partial \Omega_e),
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ denotes a Lagrange multiplier field, and
\begin{equation}
	H^{1/2} (\partial \Omega_e) \equiv \left\{ \lambda \in L^2 (\partial \Omega_e) \, | \, \exists \, \lambda' \in H^1 (\Omega_e) \, \colon \lambda = \text{tr} (\lambda') \right\}.
\end{equation}
A weak statement of the above equations can be written as
\begin{equation}
	\int_{\Omega_e} \nabla_X u \cdot \nabla_X v \, dV = 0 \quad \forall v \in H^1_0(\Omega_e).
\end{equation}
If we partition $\Omega_e$ into cells $\cup_i K_i$, we observe that
\begin{equation}
	\int_{\Omega_e} \nabla_X u \cdot \nabla_X v \, dV = \sum_j \int_{\Gamma_j} v [\![ \nabla_X u \cdot \mathbf{N} ]\!] \, dA = 0 \quad \forall v \in H^1_0(\Omega_e).
\end{equation}
If $[\![ \nabla_X u \cdot \mathbf{N} ]\!] = 0$, the above conditions are trivially satisfied. By contrast, to trivially satisfy compatibility in a weak sense, we insist that $[\![ u ]\!] = 0$ everywhere. We can consider enforcing both of these conditions in a weighted sense, resulting in the common PEM formulation in current usage:
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{F} = \sum_j \int_{\Gamma_j} \alpha_j [\![ u]\!]^2 \, dA + \sum_j \int_{\Gamma_j} \beta_j [\![ \nabla_X u \cdot \mathbf{N} ]\!]^2 \, dA.
\end{equation}
If $\alpha_j \gg \beta_j$, we obtain a field which satisfies compatibility preferrentially, whereas if $\alpha_j \ll \beta_j$, we satisfy Laplace's equation. The importance of compatibility is to guarantee that the shape functions span a set of admissible solutions to the original BVP, whereas satisfaction of Laplace's equation guarantees uniqueness of the resulting shape functions.

Alternatively, if we pose an objective functional
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{F}(u,\lambda) = \frac{1}{2} \int_{\Omega_e} \nabla_X u \cdot \nabla_X u \, dV + \int_{\partial \Omega_e} \left[ u - \bar{u} \right] \lambda \, dA,
\end{equation}
it yields
\begin{equation}
	\int_{\Omega_e} \nabla_X u \cdot \nabla_X \delta u \, dV + \int_{\partial \Omega_e} \delta u \, \lambda \, dA = 0 \quad \forall \delta u,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\int_{\partial \Omega_e} u \, \delta \lambda \, dA = \int_{\partial \Omega_e} \bar{u} \, \delta \lambda \, dA \quad \forall \delta \lambda.
\end{equation}
Suppose that we establish bases for $u$ and $\lambda$:
\begin{equation}
	u = \sum_{a=1}^{N} \varphi_a u_a, \quad \lambda = \sum_{a=1}^{M} \phi_a \lambda_a,
\end{equation}
such that
\begin{equation}
	\sum_{a=1}^N \left[ \int_{\Omega_e} \nabla_X \varphi_a \cdot \nabla_X \varphi_b \, dV \right] u_a + \sum_{c=1}^M \left[ \int_{\partial \Omega_e} \varphi_b \, \phi_c \, dA \right] \lambda_c = 0 \quad \forall b,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\sum_{b=1}^N \left[ \int_{\partial \Omega_e} \phi_c \, \varphi_b \, dA \right] u_b = \int_{\partial \Omega_e} \bar{u} \, \phi_c \, dA \quad \forall c.
\end{equation}
If we suppose that the boundary conditions can be written in terms of yet another basis, i.e.
\begin{equation}
	\bar{u} = \sum_{a=1}^N \psi_a \bar{u}_a,
\end{equation}
then
\begin{equation}
	\sum_{b=1}^N \left[ \int_{\partial \Omega_e} \phi_c \, \varphi_b \, dA \right] u_b = \sum_{a=1}^M \left[ \int_{\partial \Omega_e} \psi_a \, \phi_c \, dA \right] \bar{u}_a \quad \forall c.
\end{equation}
Given an appropriate selection for the indicated bases, we must solve the saddle-point problem, in matrix format:
\begin{equation}
	\left[ \begin{array}{cc} \mathbf{K} & \mathbf{C} \\ \mathbf{C}^T & \mathbf{0} \end{array} \right] \left\{ \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{u} \\ \boldsymbol{\lambda} \end{array} \right\} = \left\{ \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{0} \\ \mathbf{B} \bar{\mathbf{u}} \end{array} \right\},
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
	K_{ab} = \int_{\Omega_e} \nabla_X \varphi_a \cdot \nabla_X \varphi_b \, dV, \quad C_{bc} = \int_{\partial \Omega_e} \varphi_b \, \phi_c \, dA, \quad B_{ac} = \int_{\partial \Omega_e} \psi_a \, \phi_c \, dA.
\end{equation}

The generalized patch test requires that
\begin{equation}
	\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \sum_e \int_{\Omega_e} \psi \, u \, \mathbf{n} \, dA = 0 \quad \forall \psi \in C^\infty_0.
\end{equation}
Let us momentarily consider the case when each element is bounded by some $d-1$ dimensional manifold, upon which we presume that the shape functions are well-defined as $\bar{u}$. Upon any given element domain, we insist that
\begin{equation}
	\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \int_{\Omega_e} \psi \, [\![ u ]\!] \, \mathbf{n} \, dA = 0 \quad \forall \psi \in C^\infty
\end{equation}
must hold for the generalized patch test to be satisfied, where $[\![ u ]\!] = u - \bar{u}$. Suppose we define projection operators $\Pi : C^\infty(\Omega_e) \rightarrow P^k (\Omega_e)$ and $\pi : C^\infty(\Omega_e) \rightarrow C^\infty(\Omega_e) \backslash P^k (\Omega_e)$ such that
\begin{equation}
	u = \Pi u + \pi u, \quad \psi = \Pi \psi + \pi \psi,
\end{equation}
then
\begin{eqnarray}
	\int_{\Omega_e} \psi \, [\![ u ]\!] \, \mathbf{n} \, dA = \int_{\Omega_e} \Pi \psi \, \Pi [\![ u ]\!] \, \mathbf{n} \, dA + \int_{\Omega_e} \Pi \psi \, \pi [\![ u ]\!] \, \mathbf{n} \, dA \\ + \int_{\Omega_e} \pi \psi \, \Pi [\![ u ]\!] \, \mathbf{n} \, dA +
\int_{\Omega_e} \pi \psi \, \pi [\![ u ]\!] \, \mathbf{n} \, dA.
\end{eqnarray}
It can be shown that
\begin{equation}
	\int_{\Omega_e} \Pi \psi \, \Pi [\![ u ]\!] \, \mathbf{n} \, dA = 0 \quad \forall \psi \in C^\infty
\end{equation}
if the function defined on the element's boundary is sufficiently smooth, and can represent polynomial fields up to order $k$. Consequently,
\begin{eqnarray}
	\int_{\Omega_e} \psi \, [\![ u ]\!] \, \mathbf{n} \, dA = \int_{\Omega_e} \Pi \psi \, \pi [\![ u ]\!] \, \mathbf{n} \, dA \\ + \int_{\Omega_e} \pi \psi \, \Pi [\![ u ]\!] \, \mathbf{n} \, dA +
\int_{\Omega_e} \pi \psi \, \pi [\![ u ]\!] \, \mathbf{n} \, dA.
\end{eqnarray}
We effectively need to demonstrate passage of the E-1 and M-1 tests for convergence of nonconforming methods. Will need estimates for boundary integrals, or can demonstrate this numerically (preferred).

\subsection*{Weak Compatibility}

Consider the necessary and sufficient conditions for compatibility of a deformation gradient field $\mathbf{F}$ stated in equation (\ref{eq:compatibility}), reiterated:
\begin{equation}
	\nabla_X \times \mathbf{F} = \mathbf{0} \quad \forall \mathbf{X} \in \mathcal{B}_0.
\end{equation}
If the deformation gradient is computed from a set of basis functions $\left\{ \varphi_a \right\}_{a=1}^N$ for the displacement field via
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{F} = \sum_{a=1}^N \mathbf{x}_{a} \otimes \nabla_X \varphi_{a},
\end{equation}
we arrive at a set of equivalent conditions on the basis functions:
\begin{equation}
	\nabla_X \times \nabla_X \varphi = \mathbf{0} \quad \forall \mathbf{X} \in \mathcal{B}_0, \, \varphi \in \left\{ \varphi_a \right\}_{a=1}^N.
	\label{eq:strong_compatibility}
\end{equation}
These equations are trivially satisfied when the basis functions are $C^2 (\mathcal{B}_0)$ continuous, and may therefore be used to construct admissible trial solutions to the strong form statement of equilibrium described in section \ref{sec:strongform}.

In general, the construction of basis functions $\varphi \in C^2 (\mathcal{B}_0)$ is not trivial. Moreover, we seek solutions to the weak form such that $\mathbf{u} \in H^1 (\Omega)$. In what follows, we shall consider the space of functions $\varphi \in C^0 (\mathcal{B}_0)$ satisfying a weakened statement of compatibility:
\begin{equation}
	\int_{\mathcal{B}_0} (\nabla_X \times \nabla_X \varphi) \cdot \mathbf{v} \, dV = 0 \quad \forall \mathbf{v} \in C^\infty_0 (\mathcal{B}_0).
\end{equation}
Through repeated application of integration by parts, the condition that the test functions satisfy compatibility ($\nabla_X \times \nabla_X \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0} \, \forall \mathbf{v} \in C^\infty_0 (\mathcal{B}_0)$), and the divergence theorem, we determine
% e_{ijk} \varphi_{,ji} v_{k} = (e_{ijk} \varphi_{,j} v_{k})_{,i} + e_{ijk} \varphi_{,j} v_{i,k}
% e_{ijk} \varphi_{,j} v_{i,k} = (e_{ijk} \varphi v_{i,k})_{,j} - e_{ijk} \varphi v_{i,kj} = (e_{ijk} \varphi v_{i,k})_{,j}
% e_{ijk} \varphi_{,ji} v_{k} = (e_{ijk} \varphi_{,j} v_{k})_{,i} + (e_{ijk} \varphi v_{k,j})_{,i} = (e_{ijk} (\varphi v_{k})_{,j})_{,i}
 \begin{equation}
	\int_{\mathcal{B}_0} \nabla_X \cdot (\nabla_X \varphi \times \mathbf{v}) \, dV + \int_{\mathcal{B}_0} \nabla_X \varphi \cdot (\nabla_X \times \mathbf{v}) \, dV = 0,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\int_{\mathcal{B}_0} \nabla_X \cdot (\nabla_X \times (\varphi \mathbf{v})) \, dV = \int_{\partial \mathcal{B}_0} (\nabla_X \times (\varphi \mathbf{v})) \cdot d\mathbf{A} = 0.
\end{equation}

If we consider a partition $\mathcal{T}^h = \left\{ \Omega_e \right\}_{e=1}^{N_e}$ of $\mathcal{B}_0$ into polytopal elements $\Omega_e \subset \mathcal{B}_0$ whose shape functions are assumed to be piece-wise smooth and continuous on element interiors, then we may impose the equivalent condition:
\begin{equation}
	\sum_{e = 1}^{N_e} \int_{\partial \Omega_e} (\nabla_X \times (\varphi|_{\Omega_e} \mathbf{v})) \cdot d\mathbf{A} = 0 \quad \forall \varphi, \, \mathbf{v} \in C^\infty_0 (\mathcal{B}_0).
\end{equation}
It it evident that if $[\![ \varphi ]\!] = \varphi|_{\Omega_a} - \varphi|_{\Omega_b} = 0 \, \forall \partial \Omega_a \cap \partial \Omega_b \neq \emptyset$, then the above condition is trivially satisfied. Such is the case for $C^0 (\mathcal{B}_0)$ conforming finite element methods.

If $\varphi \not\subset C^0 (\mathcal{B}_0)$, we require
\begin{equation}
	\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \sum_{e = 1}^{N_e} \int_{\partial \Omega_e} (\nabla_X \times (\varphi|_{\Omega_e} \mathbf{v})) \cdot d\mathbf{A} = 0 \quad \forall \varphi, \, \mathbf{v} \in C^\infty_0 (\mathcal{B}_0),
\end{equation}
which is equivalent to
\begin{equation}
	\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \sum_{e = 1}^{N_e} \int_{\partial \Omega_e} (\varphi|_{\Omega_e} (\nabla_X \times \mathbf{v}) + \nabla_X \varphi|_{\Omega_e} \times \mathbf{v}) \cdot d\mathbf{A} = 0 \quad \forall \varphi, \, \mathbf{v} \in C^\infty_0 (\mathcal{B}_0).
\end{equation}
Equivalently, we may enforce this condition over each individual face $\Gamma = \Omega_a \cap \Omega_b \neq \emptyset$, such that
\begin{equation}
	\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \int_{\Gamma} ([\![ \varphi ]\!] (\nabla_X \times \mathbf{v}) + \nabla_X [\![ \varphi ]\!] \times \mathbf{v}) \cdot d\mathbf{A} = 0 \quad \forall \Gamma, \, \mathbf{v} \in C^\infty_0 (\mathcal{B}_0).
\end{equation}
We may expand $[\![ \varphi ]\!] = a_0 + \mathbf{a}_1 \cdot \mathbf{X} + O(\mathbf{X}^2)$ and $\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{b}_0 + \mathbf{B}_1 \mathbf{X} + O(\mathbf{X}^2)$ in terms of low-order polynomials to illustrate
\begin{equation}
	\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \int_{\Gamma} ((a_0 + \mathbf{a}_1 \cdot \mathbf{X}) \mathbf{B}_1 + \mathbf{a}_1 \times (\mathbf{b}_0 + \mathbf{B}_1 \mathbf{X})) \cdot d\mathbf{A} = 0 \quad \forall \Gamma, \, \mathbf{v} \in C^\infty_0 (\mathcal{B}_0).
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \sum_{e = 1}^{N_e} \int_{\partial \Omega_e} (\varphi|_{\Omega_e} (\nabla_X \times \mathbf{v})) \cdot d\mathbf{A} - \sum_{e = 1}^{N_e} \int_{\Omega_e} \nabla_X \varphi|_{\Omega_e} \cdot (\nabla_X \times \mathbf{v}) \, dV = 0 \quad \forall \varphi, \, \mathbf{v} \in C^\infty_0 (\mathcal{B}_0),
\end{equation}
and because $\nabla_X \times : C^\infty_0 (\mathcal{B}_0) \mapsto C^\infty_0 (\mathcal{B}_0)$, we have
\begin{equation}
	\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \sum_{e = 1}^{N_e} \int_{\partial \Omega_e} \varphi|_{\Omega_e} \mathbf{v} \cdot d\mathbf{A} - \sum_{e = 1}^{N_e} \int_{\Omega_e} \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla_X \varphi|_{\Omega_e} \, dV = 0 \quad \forall \varphi, \, \mathbf{v} \in C^\infty_0 (\mathcal{B}_0).
\end{equation}
Recognizing that
\begin{equation}
	\int_{\Omega_e} \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla_X \varphi|_{\Omega_e} \, dV \leq  || \nabla_X \varphi|_{\Omega_e} ||^2_{\Omega_e},
\end{equation}

If we insist on
\begin{equation}
	\sum_{e = 1}^{N_e} \int_{\partial \Omega_e} (\nabla_X \times (\varphi|_{\Omega_e} \mathbf{v})) \cdot d\mathbf{A} = 0 \quad \forall \varphi, \, \mathbf{v} \in P^1 (\mathcal{B}_0),
\end{equation}
i.e. if we expand $\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v}_0 + \mathbf{V}_1 \mathbf{x}$ and 
\begin{equation}
	\sum_{e = 1}^{N_e} \int_{\partial \Omega_e} (\nabla_X \times (\varphi|_{\Omega_e} \mathbf{v})) \cdot d\mathbf{A} = 0 \quad \forall \varphi, \, \mathbf{v} \in P^1 (\mathcal{B}_0),
\end{equation}

Traditional approximation methods typically consider the independent specification of two principal transformations: an interpolation scheme, which is necessary to represent field variables according to known point-values; and a quadrature rule, for the purposes of integrating such fields over the domain on which they are defined.

In mathematical terms, an interpolant $\varphi$ is a linear operator which maps vectors $\mathbf{u} \in \mathbb{R}^k$ containing point-wise data regarding a field into scalar functions $f \in V^k (\Omega)$, i.e.
\begin{equation}
  \varphi \colon \mathbb{R}^k \mapsto V^k (\Omega)
\end{equation}
where $\mathbb{R}^k$ is a $k$-dimensional real space, and $V^k (\Omega)$ is a $k$-dimensional function space defined on $\Omega$.

By constrast, a quadrature rule $\Sigma$ is a linear operator which maps scalar functions $f \in V^k (\Omega)$ to vectors $\mathbf{q} \in \mathbb{R}^p$ identifying point-wise samples of $f$, i.e.
\begin{equation}
  \Sigma \colon V^k (\Omega) \mapsto \mathbb{R}^p
\end{equation}

The composition $\Sigma \circ \varphi$ of an interpolant $\varphi$ with a quadrature rule $\Sigma$ yields a linear operator
\begin{equation}
  \Sigma \circ \varphi \colon \mathbb{R}^k \mapsto \mathbb{R}^p
\end{equation}

\subsection{Partition-Based Quadrature Rules}

		%quadrature rules are defined/linked to the chosen partition
		%1-to-1 relation between partitioned cells and quadrature points
		%use Lassere integration to get weights of polytopal domains
		%employ low-order quadrature rules for the sake of efficiency
		%FE/simplicial discretization allows high-order composite rules
		
% need to integrate weak form terms on polytopes and their boundaries
	% must account for nonlinear kinematic and material behavior
	% must guarantee sufficient stability (inf-sup)
	% must be sufficiently accurate (Galerkin exactness)
If arbitrary polytopal shapes are to be used as elements in the PEM, then we must devise a means of integrating contributions to the weak form	, ostensibly through the use of quadrature rules on the elements' interiors and boundaries. Such rules must be sufficiently stable (utilizing a sufficient number of well-positioned quadrature points) and accurate (capable of exactly integrating low-order polynomials up to some specified degree).
	
% PEM approaches this task with the aid of partition-based quadrature rules
	% Elements are partitioned/discretized into sub-domains
		% Number of sub-domains should be sufficient to guarantee stability
	% Quadrature rules are defined on each sub-domain
	% Composite quadrature rules are assembled by considering these quadratures taken together
Partitioned element methods proceed by partitioning the elements (and their boundaries) into a sufficient number of polytopal sub-domains which are used as integration cells. Low-order (i.e. 1-point) quadrature rules are defined on each of these sub-domains, and a composite quadrature rule for the element is assembled from the collection of all quadrature points in each sub-domain. In general, these quadrature rules will need to be modified to satisfy Galerkin exactness for certain low-order polynomial solutions.
	
% Quadrature rules are adjusted after-the-fact by considering an exact integration of low-order polynomial terms to guarantee Galerkin exactness
	% may be viewed as a type of gradient correction measure
	% applied to each quadrature (interior and boundary) separately
% discuss particular in the following sub-sections:
Methods for partitioning the elements into sub-domains which yield stable and efficient composite quadrature rules are discussed in the following section. Later discussion is given to the correction of these quadratures for the sake of satisfying Galerkin exactness (quadrature consistency).
		
	\subsubsection*{Composite Quadrature Rules}
	
	Given a partition of the elements into sub-domains (quadrature cells), one may utilize a low order quadrature rule over each sub-domain, thereby yielding a composite quadrature rule over the element as a whole, whose overall accuracy is determined by the order of accuracy used in each sub-domain.
	
	The simplest quadrature rule of this form is a composite mid-point scheme, where the quadrature points are located at the centroids of each sub-domain. Such a rule exactly integrates polynomials up to first order, and is otherwise reasonably accurate. The integration points are guaranteed to be interior to each sub-domain (and the element as a whole) provided each cell is convex.
	
	For simple sub-divisions (consisting of triangles or tetrahedra), composite quadrature rules may be extended to obtain high-order accuracy. For generic sub-divisions (consiting of arbitrary polytopes), the extension to high-order is not clear. For this reason, we will focus attention on composite mid-point rules.
	
	A number of different partitioning schemes are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:partitioning_types}.
	\begin{figure} [!ht]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width = 6.0in]{figures/partition_types.pdf}
		\caption{Various element partitioning schemes. From left to right: edge-based partition, node-based partition, voronoi partition.}
		\label{fig:partitioning_types}
	\end{figure}
	In general, the resulting cells $\omega$ may possess arbitrary polytopal shape, whose centroids $\bar{\mathbf{X}}$ may be computed via
	\begin{equation}
		\bar{\mathbf{X}} = \frac{\int_{\omega} \mathbf{X} \, dV}{\int_{\omega} dV}.
	\end{equation}
	We may compute polynomial moments on any arbitrary polytope using the method proposed by Lasserre et al. in \cite{Chin:15}, such that
	\begin{equation}
		\int_{\omega} \mathbf{X}^\alpha \, dV = \frac{1}{d+|\alpha|} \int_{\partial \omega} (\mathbf{X} \cdot \mathbf{N}) \, \mathbf{X}^\alpha \, dA.
	\end{equation}
		
	\subsubsection*{Selective Modal Quadrature}
	
	Consider all functions $f \in L^2 (\Omega)$ represented over an arbitrary polytopal element domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. Standard quadrature rules approximate the integral of $f$ over $\Omega$ as
	\begin{equation}
		\int_\Omega f \, dv \approx \sum_{q=1}^{N_{qp}} w_q f(\mathbf{x}_q).
	\end{equation}
	Consider an $L^2 (\Omega)$ polynomial projection operator $\Pi : L^2 \mapsto P^k$ which may be used to decompose $f = f_p + f_n$ into polynomial and non-polynomial parts:
	\begin{equation}
		f_p = \Pi f, \quad f_n = f - \Pi f = \pi f,
	\end{equation}
	where $\pi : L^2 \mapsto L^2 \backslash P^k$. Consequently, we observe that $\Pi f$ is $L^2$ orthogonal to any $\pi g$ for all $g \in L^2$, to the extent that
	\begin{equation}
		\int_{\Omega} (\Pi f) (g - \Pi g) \, dv = \langle \Pi f, g - \Pi g \rangle_{\Omega} = 0 \quad \forall f, \, g \in L^2.
	\end{equation}
	
	We propose a quadrature rule of the form:
	\begin{equation}
		\int_\Omega f \, dv \approx \int_\Omega f_p \, dv + \sum_{q=1}^{N_{qp}} w_q f_n(\mathbf{x}_q),
	\end{equation}
	where it is supposed that $\int_\Omega f_p \, dv$ may be computed exactly using the methodology proposed by Lasserre in \cite{Chin:15}. Further, if we wish to integrate the product $f g$ where $f, \, g \in H^1 (\Omega)$, we may write
	\begin{equation}
		\int_\Omega f g \, dv = \langle f, g \rangle_{\Omega} = \langle \Pi f + \pi f, \Pi g + \pi  g \rangle_{\Omega},
	\end{equation}
	which, by the linearity of the $L_2$ inner product, and by the orthogonality of $\Pi f$ and $\pi g$ (and of $\pi f$ and $\Pi g$), yields
	\begin{equation}
		\int_\Omega f g \, dv = \langle \Pi f, \Pi g \rangle_{\Omega} + \langle \pi f, \pi g \rangle_{\Omega},
	\end{equation}
	and thus
	\begin{equation}
		\int_\Omega f g \, dv \approx \int_\Omega f_p g_p \, dv + \sum_{q=1}^{N_{qp}} w_q f_n(\mathbf{x}_q) g_n(\mathbf{x}_q).
	\end{equation}
	This is effectively equivalent to integrating the product of all low-order polynomials exactly, while integrating the product of all non-polynomial ``remainders'' only approximately, using a quadrature rule.
	
	If we are only given point evaluations of a function $f$ at $\left\{ \mathbf{x}_q \right\}_{q=1}^{N_{qp}}$, then we must construct a low-order polynomial projection operator by considering the least-squares problem:
	\begin{equation}
		\min_{f_p \in P^k (\Omega)} \frac{1}{2} || f_p - f ||^2_\Omega,
	\end{equation}
	where $|| f ||_\Omega = \sqrt{\langle f, f \rangle_\Omega}$ is deliberately approximated using the element's quadrature rule:
	\begin{equation}
		\langle f, f \rangle_\Omega \approx \sum_{q=1}^{N_{qp}} w_q \left[ f(\mathbf{x}_q) \right]^2.
		\label{eq:L2projection}
	\end{equation}
	For a given polynomial basis $\left\{ z_a \right\}_{a=1}^{K}$ which spans $P^k (\Omega)$, we may write
	\begin{equation}
		f_p (\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{a=1}^{K} z_a (\mathbf{x}) c_a = \mathbf{z}^T (\mathbf{x}) \, \mathbf{c},
	\end{equation}
	and the solution to (\ref{eq:L2projection}) satisfies
	\begin{equation}
		\sum_{a=1}^{K} \sum_{q=1}^{N_{qp}} w_q z_b (\mathbf{x}_q) z_a (\mathbf{x}_q) c_a =
		\sum_{q=1}^{N_{qp}} w_q z_b (\mathbf{x}_q) f(\mathbf{x}_q) \quad \forall b = 1, \, \ldots, \, K,
	\end{equation}
	which may be written in matrix form as $\mathbf{Z}^T \mathbf{W} \mathbf{Z} \mathbf{c} = \mathbf{Z}^T \mathbf{W} \mathbf{f}$, where we denote $f_i = f(\mathbf{x}_i)$, $W_{ii} = w_i, \, W_{ij} = 0 \, \forall i \neq j$, and $Z_{ij} = z_j (\mathbf{x}_i)$. The discrete polynomial projection operator $\mathbf{\Pi} : \mathbb{R}^{N_{qp}} \mapsto \mathbb{R}^K$ is computed as $\boldsymbol{\Pi} = (\mathbf{Z}^T \mathbf{W} \mathbf{Z})^{-1} \mathbf{Z}^T \mathbf{W}$, and the complement operator $\boldsymbol{\pi} : \mathbb{R}^{N_{qp}} \mapsto \mathbb{R}^{N_{qp}}$ is $\boldsymbol{\pi} = \mathbf{1}_{N_{qp}} - \boldsymbol{\Pi}^\dagger \boldsymbol{\Pi}$. Consequently,
	\begin{equation}
		\langle \Pi f, \Pi g \rangle_{\Omega} = \langle \mathbf{z}^T \boldsymbol{\Pi} \mathbf{f}, \mathbf{z}^T \boldsymbol{\Pi} \mathbf{g} \rangle_{\Omega} = \mathbf{f}^T \left[ \boldsymbol{\Pi}^T \left( \int_{\Omega} \mathbf{z} \otimes \mathbf{z} \, dv \right) \boldsymbol{\Pi} \right] \mathbf{g} = \mathbf{f}^T \mathbf{W}_p \mathbf{g},
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}
		\langle \pi f, \pi g \rangle_{\Omega} \approx \sum_{q=1}^{N_{qp}} w_q f_n(\mathbf{x}_q) g_n(\mathbf{x}_q) = \mathbf{f}^T \left[ \boldsymbol{\pi}^T \mathbf{W} \boldsymbol{\pi} \right] \mathbf{g} = \mathbf{f}^T \mathbf{W}_n \mathbf{g},
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}
		\int_\Omega f g \, dv \approx \mathbf{f}^T (\mathbf{W}_p + \mathbf{W}_n) \mathbf{g} = \mathbf{f}^T \mathbf{M} \mathbf{g} = \sum_{q = 1}^{N_{qp}} \sum_{p = 1}^{N_{qp}} M (\mathbf{x}_q,\mathbf{x}_p) \, f (\mathbf{x}_q) \, g (\mathbf{x}_p).
	\end{equation}
	
	We shall refer to this form of integration as \textit{selective modal quadrature}, in that particular low-order polynomial modes are integrated exactly, and any higher modes are approximated using the element's quadrature rules. The advantage of modal quadrature is that we may exactly integrate any terms which directly impact quadrature consistency, and hence, virtually any stable quadrature may be used to integrate the higher-order part.
	
	Rather than storing the independent quadrature weights $w_q = w (\mathbf{x}_q)$, selective modal quadrature requires the storage of a generalized quadrature weighting matrix $M (\mathbf{x}_q,\mathbf{x}_p)$. Alternatively, for the sake of efficiency, if the function $g$ is known a priori (e.g. if $g$ is a test function for a weighted residual method), then we need only store the ``augmented'' test function values:
	\begin{equation}
		\tilde{g} (\mathbf{x}_q) = \sum_{p = 1}^{N_{qp}} \frac{M(\mathbf{x}_q,\mathbf{x}_p)}{w_q} \, g (\mathbf{x}_p),
	\end{equation}		
	and all integrals involving $f$ and $g$ may be carried out via
	\begin{equation}
		\int_\Omega f g \, dv \approx \sum_{q = 1}^{N_{qp}} \, w_q \, \tilde{g} (\mathbf{x}_q) \, f (\mathbf{x}_q),
	\end{equation}
	which is effectively equivalent to a gradient correction scheme, similar to the method proposed in \cite{Talischi:15}.

Once we have specified a given approximation space of functions, our goal is then to select the function from this space which best represents the nodal data that we are attempting to interpolate over the element. The essential question is this: by what metric should we objectively assess the appropriateness of a given approximating function?

\section{Essential Requirements of the PEM}

\subsection*{Reproducibility}

Fundamentally, the approximation power of the PEM depends directly upon the degree of completeness of the underlying approximation space. In particular, the finite-dimensional trial solution space $\mathcal{S}^h$ should contain as a subspace $\mathbb{P}_k \subset \mathcal{S}^h$ for some $k \geq 0$, where $\mathbb{P}_k$ denotes the subspace of polynomial functions with maximal degree $k$. This guarantees that the PEM approximation space will be capable of exactly reproducing any polynomial function up to some specified order.

	%driven by the generalized patch test

\subsubsection*{Weak Compatibility}
\subsection*{Stability}

		%driven by the inf-sup conditions
		%handled via sufficient quadrature arrangement

\subsubsection*{Restrictions on the Element Partition}
\subsection*{Variational Consistency}
\subsubsection*{Weak Enforcement of Consistency}

		%driven by Galerkin exactness
		%enforced by quadrature accuracy
		%alternatively via lagrange multiplier constraint

Recall the $\alpha$-th order variational consistency requirements:
\begin{equation}
  \int_\Omega \mathbf{x}^{\alpha} \varphi_{a,i} \, dv + \int_\Omega \mathbf{x}^{\alpha}_{,i} \varphi_a \, dv = \int_{\partial \Omega} \mathbf{x}^{\alpha} n_i \varphi_a \, da \quad \forall i, a.
\end{equation}
This degree of consistency is required for all $| \alpha | \leq k-1$ if the bi-linear form $a : \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{V} \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ is to determine uniqueness of any exact polynomial solutions up to order $k$ contained within $\mathcal{S}^h \supset P_k$. Moreover, the above expression implies that any solution may be reasonably well approximated by low-order polynomials in the locality of the selected domain $\Omega$.

Consequently, we may consider an application of the above consistency requirements to the entire problem domain $\Omega$, or -- more practically -- we may enforce consistency up to the desired order on each element domain $\Omega_e$. The element-local $\alpha$-th order consistency equations follow:
\begin{equation}
  \int_{\Omega_e} \mathbf{x}^{\alpha} \varphi_{a,i} \, dv + \int_{\Omega_e} \mathbf{x}^{\alpha}_{,i} \varphi_a \, dv = \int_{\partial \Omega_e} \mathbf{x}^{\alpha} n_i \varphi_a \, da \quad \forall i, a.
  \label{eq:consistency3}
\end{equation}

In most practical situations, it may not be possible to evaluate the integral expressions exactly. Instead, numerical quadrature rules must be defined, both on the element's interior, and on its boundary, such that
\begin{equation}
  \int_{\Omega_e} f(\mathbf{x}) dv \approx \sum_{q=1}^{N_q} w_q f(\mathbf{x}_q), \quad \int_{\partial \Omega_e} f(\mathbf{x}) da \approx \sum_{b=1}^{N_b} w_b f(\mathbf{x}_b).
\end{equation}
This yields yet another form of consistency, henceforth referred to as ``quadrature consistency,'' expressed as:
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{q=1}^{N_q} w_q \left[ \mathbf{x}_q^{\alpha} \varphi^{(q)}_{a,i} + \mathbf{x}^{\alpha}_{q,i} \varphi^{(q)}_a \right] = \sum_{b=1}^{N_b} w_b \mathbf{x}_b^{\alpha} n^{(b)}_i \varphi^{(b)}_a \quad \forall i, a.
  \label{eq:quadrature_consistency3}
\end{equation}
Moving forward in our developments, quadrature consistency will be the only form of consistency of practical interest, as it appropriately reflects the discrete data quantities at our disposal.

A brief remark should be made regarding the lack of equivalence between the exact evaluation of consistency in equation (\ref{eq:consistency3}) and its numerical approximation in equation (\ref{eq:quadrature_consistency3}). In general, we cannot claim that satisfaction of one guarantees the other. There is only one occasion when we may say that (\ref{eq:quadrature_consistency3}) holds if and only if (\ref{eq:consistency3}) is satisfied, which occurs only when sufficiently accurate quadrature rules are used on the element and its boundary. In the vast majority of situations, however, this is an impractical constraint, as the construction of high-order quadrature rules on arbitrary polyhedra (though possible) proves to be somewhat computationally intensive (see the literature by Sukumar, etc.). Moreover, without a precise representation of the test functions over the element domain, it becomes infeasible to consider an exact integration of such functions.

\subsection*{Numerical Quadrature Consistency}

Beyond consistency with the weak form for a specified subspace of polynomial functions used to represent the solution, we also require that the numerical quadrature scheme utilized be sufficiently accurate to the extent that: Galerkin exactness is satisfied for certain classes of solutions, and that the quadrature error has a bound which is of a lower order than that of the approximation error.
