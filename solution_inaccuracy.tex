(A review of various approaches that have been taken to solve the aforementioned problem, and an assessment of their relative efficacies (advantages, disadvantages), possibly presented in chronological order, though it may be acceptable to present the material in a format that organizes different methodologies according to the degree of similarity in their approach. The variety of different approaches should be justified based on their intended applications, and should additionally illustrate the fact that the issue being addressed is one which has yet to be fully solved in a robust and general way. Include most of the references within this section and its relevant sub-sections. All references should be made relevant to the subject, and not meandering.)
