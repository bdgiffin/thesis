Timeline:
	November - Scoping + Writing
	December - Writing
	January - Results + Revision
	February - Editing + Review
	March 9th - Submission (2 days before)

Only have (less than) 3 months to write! We're going to need to burn the midnight oil. :)

Goals:
	By the end of November: Have a fully scoped out manuscript, with descriptions of what will go where, and bulleted ideas for everything that will ultimately be contained within the thesis.
	By the end of December: Have a fully written manuscript (rough draft) with completed descriptions that supplement all bullet points that had been scoped out - pass this off to Mark for initial editing.
	By the end of January:  Have a fully revised manuscript; this should be edited based on Mark's comments, and will include all figures and test results that would have been needed based on the scoped out goals.

November:
	13th-19th: High-level scoping for all chapters
		14th (Tuesday):   Long-term planning (i.e. this document)
				  Read T for Transformation to get pumped; sleep/wake up early
				  Dig deep!
		15th (Wednesday): Scoping for the thesis as a whole (re-structure, as needed)
				  Reorganize the overall outline at the chapter level
				  	-settle on the high-level content for each chapter
					-lay out game-plan for each chapter
					-everything should be united under a central thesis/idea
					-explain what SHOULD and SHOULD NOT be included in each chptr
					-create discrete bullet points that enumerate the specific 
					 things that you want to say, and organize them into the
					 appropriate chapters (re-organize content)
					-decide which references need to be discussed where
					-ultimately hammer down precisely what is going to make the
					 cut, and what is not as far as content is concerned
					-focus on what you have, right now; not on what you don't
					-provide motivating advice for laying out content in each chpt
					-consider working backward from what you intend to present
					 at the very end of the thesis -- what are you trying to say?
				  Plan out discrete goals for Thursday (tomorrow), and beyond (recap)
		16th (Thursday):  Scoping for the INTRODUCTORY chapter
				  Consider what contextual information is relevant
					-ORGANIZE REFERENCES, regarding the order in which they
					 should be discussed, and consider how this aids in telling
					 the story that you are communicating
					-quickly skim through older theses to ESTABLISH A BASIS FOR
					 COMPARISON (perhaps even "steal" references/ideas)
		17th (Friday):    Scoping for the BACKGROUND chapters
				  Consider what contextual information is relevant
					-ORGANIZE REFERENCES, regarding the order in which they
					 should be discussed, and consider how this aids in telling
					 the story that you are communicating
					-quickly skim through older theses to ESTABLISH A BASIS FOR
					 COMPARISON (perhaps even "steal" references/ideas)
		18th (Saturday):  Scoping for the expositional (PEM, methods) chapters
				  Consider topics for further exploration (scope remaining work)
					-explore idea of quadrature basis (maybe infeasible ~ 1hr max)
					-consider alternative discretization methods
		19th (Sunday):    Scoping for the demonstrative (results, conclusions) chapters
				  Consider topics for further exploration (scope remaining work)
					-create a list of interesting problems to run
					-make sure these problems aid in addressing the central thesis
					-make sure problems test/demonstrate independent things:
						*convergence (distorsional loss of accuracy/converg)
							!go to truly higher-orders (3rd, 4th, 5th max)
							 (this alone is worth the whole dissertation)
						*element distorsion (trapezoidal locking)
						*thin limit (shear locking)
						*incompressibility (volumetric locking)
	20th-26th: Mid-level  scoping for all sections
		20th (Monday):    Long-term planning (revise this document)
				  Scoping for the implementation chapter
		21st (Tuesday):   Long-term planning (revise this document)
				  Scoping for the demonstrative (results, conclusions) chapters
				  Consider topics for further exploration (scope remaining work)
					-create a list of interesting problems to run

March:
	5th-9th: Handle meeting/submission logistics

Things to avoid:
	-Do not write an automated meshing utility; map/steal/make meshes by hand if you have to.
		(prefer to create SIMPLE tests that demonstrate efficacy, without overlap)
		(focus is on the element FORMULATION, not on meshing -- see other disserations)
	-Do not go overboard with examples, the idea is to present the work you did, thus far.
	-Talk about the problem that curved faces pose, but do not attempt to solve this problem
	 (quantifying this problem is probably insightful enough, and needn't be addressed here).
