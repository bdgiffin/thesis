%NUMERICAL INVESTIGATIONS OF PEM
	*compare efficacy of various PEM approaches
	*try to see which formulation is the most robust/accurate
	*investigate sensitivity to choice of internal penalty parameters in the element formulations
	*examine behavior of the elements in canonical locking type problems
		-volumetric locking
		-shear locking (thin elements)
	$PATCH TESTS
		&LINEAR PATCH TEST(S)
			*2D & 3D
			*with and without consistency correction
			*BG vs PG
			*sensitivity to patch distorsion
		&QUADRATIC PATCH TEST(S)
			*2D & 3D
			*with and without consistency correction
			*BG vs PG
			*sensitivity to patch distorsion
	$CONVERGENCE STUDIES
		*investigate convergence for high-order shape functions
		*exploration of accuracy/convergence in refinement limit (limited by SF errors?)
			-exploration of effects of numerical accuracy & system conditioning
		&PLATE WITH HOLE PROBLEM (2D)
			*compare against serendipity and lagrange elements
			*demonstrate loss of convergence for serendipity isoparametric elements
			*demonstrate higher-order convergence for PEM shape functions
		
	$SENSITIVITY ANALYSES
		*examine sensitivity to mesh distortions
		*sensitivity to internal (penalty) parameters
		*senstivity to material parameters / dependency
		*assess whether optimal values exist, whether formulation too sensitive
	$LOCKING PERFORMANCE
		*primary goal is to assess performance for coarse resolution meshes
		&THIN PLATE BENDING PROBLEM (3D)
			*use global error metrics to assess performance (L2 and H1 measures)
				-should have 
			*investigate sensitivity to mesh distortions
			*investigate sensitivity to material parameters
		&PINCHED PIPE PROBLEM (3D)
			*run using finite deformations
			*refer to Bischoff's work on continuum shell formulations
			*prefer a polyhedral mesh, if this is feasible
			*compare against standard conforming hex elements (expect poor performance)
			*displacement controlled pinch to illustrate localization performance
		&TWISTING ANNULUS (2D plane strain)
			*inner radius remains fixed, outer radius rigidly rotates
			*individual elements should experience simple shear AND some bending
				-bending deformation causes locking/bad stress field
			*nearly incompressible material model
			*measure stress error (should exhibit locking behavior)
			*there should exist an exact, axisymmetric solution
				-provide derivation/approximation to the analytic solution
