%FRAMEWORK FOR FINITE DEFORMATION INCREMENTAL KINEMATICS
	$OVERVIEW
		*state the problem
			-hypoelastic corotational time integration
			-most models handle only stretching
			-must decompose motion into stretching & rotation
	$GENERALIZED MATERIAL UPDATE
		*material state must be described at a discrete point
			-kinematic state data, strain
			-material (internal) state data, stress
		*material state updated from state k to k+1
			-pass an increment of deformation (F_hat)
			-decompose F_hat into rotation and stretch increments
			-update material state in sequence (stretch, rotate)
	$KINEMATIC SPLITTING
		*choice of splitting determines which corotational rate
		*describe methods for performing kinematic splitting
			-Hughes-Winget
			-Rashid 1993
		*describe new method
			-exponential Lie splitting of L
			-use method of Scherzinger & Dorhmann for eignedecomp
			-use accurate derivatives based on eigenstuff
	$EXPLORATION OF ACCURACY
		*single step accuracy convergence rate comparisons
			-stretch & rotate problem
			-simple shear problem
		*twisting prism problem
	$EXPLORATION OF CONVERGENCE
		*pressurized eccentric cylinder problem
