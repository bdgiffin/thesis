@PRIMARY purpose of this chapter is to contextualize choice of notation for later on!
@SECONDARY purpose is to explain the structure of SM problems:
	displacements -> strains/F (possibly nonlinear kinematics, due to Lagrangian)
	strains/F -> stresses (possibly nonlinear constitutive behavior)
	stresses -> forces (current configuration equilibrium)
@TERTIARY purpose is to present the weak form for solid mechanics: THE model problem
@EMPHASIZE that the problems we would like to solve are nonlinear; not amenable to
           VEM stabilization, or fancy boundary integrals (i.e. Suku's work)
@ASSUME that the reader is familiar with solid mechanics; just explain your notation
#DO NOT go into excessive/repetitious detail
#DO NOT derive anything, just state the equations and define the notation

!IDEA: use this chapter to discuss kinematic update procedures (would entail a rather lengthy section)
