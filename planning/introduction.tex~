\chapter{Introduction}

% OPENING (scope of the thesis)

	% A high-level description of the research setting:
		% Efficient & accurate approximation methods for nonlinear solid mechanics
	For decades, finite element methods have been a useful tool for engineers and physicists to model the deformation of solid bodies. Numerous extensions of the method have been developed in an effort to model more complex physical processes, including nonlinear kinematic and material behavior.

	% A high% level statement of the fundamental problem(s):
		% FE solution accuracy is compromised by the issues of locking and mesh quality
		% Proposed solutions handle some, but not all of these problems
	Despite these advances, traditional finite element methods have been plagued by recurrent issues of numerical accuracy pertaining to locking and poor mesh quality. Various strategies have been proposed to overcome some of these issues, though few have been able to address the underlying problem of element distorsion sensitivity.

	% A high-level statement of the proposed solution(s):
		% Thesis presents a polytopal element framework to address these issues
		% Polyhedral discretization is aimed at overcoming issues of mesh quality
		% Framework is amenable to classical FE procedures used to address locking
	This thesis presents a polytopal element framework to address the aforementioned issues. The use of arbitrary polygonal and polyhedral shapes in place of the standard element shapes used in FEM seeks to address the issue of distorsion sensitivity directly, obviating issues of meshing and mesh quality, while maintaining many of the desirable features of the FEM.

\section{Historical Development} % (what has led up to polyhedral discretizations)

	% Origin of finite element methods, applied to solid mechanics problems
		% Finite elements developed initially for LINEAR, structural problems
	According to \cite{Felippa:04}, finite element methods originated in the 1950s to address challenges related to the engineering design of aircraft. More rigorous mathematical justifications of the method were developed later on, and its usage permeated to other fields of study (namely, in structural engineering applications). Following the advent of isoparametric element formulations, displacement-based finite element methods gained widespread popularity, though most early applications considered only linear kinematic and material behavior.
	% Subsequently, more complicated models were developed to accomodate nonlinearities:
		% Finite deformations incorporated to handle non-linear geometric effects
		% Advanced constitutive models developed for plastic and viscoelastic materials
		% Contact between deformable bodies (more geometric non-linearity)
	Subsequently, advanced solution methodologies were developed to accomodate various sources of nonlinearity, including finite deformations, nonlinear constitutive behavior, and contact.

	% Finite element methods still hold up in the aforementioned contexts because:
		% Compact support property of basis functions yields efficient solutions
			% Domain decomposition more straightforward, parallel scalability
		% Element quadrature rules effectively consider individual material points
			% leads to reasonable accuracy and solution efficiency
			% directly compatible with the theory of continuum mechanics
			% naturally accomodates non-linear kinematics
			% naturally accomodates non-linear constitutive models
		% Yields a precise description of mesh boundaries
			% allows for straightforward contact enforcement
			% application of other BC's (FSI pressure coupling) also straightforward
	Over half a century after its initial development, the finite element method is still widely used, and recognized as the industry standard method for modeling complicated structural systems. It's reigning popularity can be attributed to several desirable features of the method:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[1.)] The compact support property of the isoparametric basis functions helps to facilitate more efficient solution methodologies.
		\item[2.)] The kronecker delta property and precise description of mesh boundaries allow for a relatively straightforward application of boundary conditions and contact constraints.
		\item[3.)] Numerical quadrature on element domains derived from product Gauss rules balances accuracy, efficiency, and stability, while naturally accomodating nonlinear kinematic and material behavior.
	\end{itemize}

	% However, finite element methods have suffered from two major (but related) issues:
		% Poor solution accuracy due to effects of ``locking''
			% The quality and type of discretization heavily impacts accuracy
			% Low order elements suffer the most from these issues
			% Linear tetrahedra and triangles are the worst offenders
			% Thin an distorted elements perform poorly
		% Meshing of complex geometries into quality discretizations is difficult
			% Generally time-consuming to produce quality meshes (human effort)
			% Hard or impossible to avoid mesh distorsion
			% Recent developments have been made towards hex-dominant meshing
				% still limited by element distortion

	\subsection{``Locking'' in Finite elements}
		% Concerted efforts were made to address the issues of locking:
		% Higher-order elements
			% shown to eliminate locking issues at high enough order
			% accuracy still highly contingent on element distortion
		% Selective Reduced Integration techniques
			% developed to handle incompressibility constraint
			% works fairly well, though 
		% Hourglass stiffness and viscosity
			% use underintegration of the element (single point quadrature)
			% supplement with (small) artificial stiffness & viscosity parameters
			% efficient computationally, especially for explicit dynamics
			% an ad hoc solution, sensitive to the choice of HG parameters
		% Mixed formulations based on Hu-Washizu principle
			% one of the most robust solutions to locking
			% directed at incompressibility, resolves pressure field accurately
			% requires the interpolation of displacement, strain, and stress fields
			% must satisfy the inf-sup (LBB) conditions for stability
			% somewhat limited, based on the choice for the material model
			% can suffer from issues of numerical conditioning
		% Method of incompatible modes
			% aimed mostly at improving bending performance of elements
			% based on mixed formulations, reduced to 2-field method
			% considers enhanced strain mode degrees of freedom
			% enhanced dofs can be condensed out at the element level
			% performance of elements is still sensitive to mesh distortion
		% Important point: most of these methods restricted to standard (hex) elements
			% not easily generalizable/extensible to other elements/methods
			% moreover, standard isoparametric elements are part of the problem
				% led to development of alternative methods/discretizations
	
	\subsection{Alternative Numerical Methods and Discretizations}
		% Efforts toward meshing & element quality led to new methods & discretizations
		% Meshfree methods
			% avoid issues of mesh sensitivity altogether -- abandon the mesh
			% construct shape functions using weighting/kernal functions
			% several different varieties: SPH, MLS, RKPM, Max-Ent
			% solutions tend to be much smoother
			% able to handle severe/extreme deformations & changing topology
			% lose compact support property; less computationally efficient
			% boundaries are not well-defined; handling of BCs and contact is hard
			% suffers from issues of numerical integration; lose consistency
			% need to define a background mesh for integration (NOT mesh-free)
		% Discontinuous Galerkin methods
			% accomodate arbitrary polytopal domains
			% solution within a given polytopal domain is locally polynomial
			% tends to be fairly robust across different discretizations
			% relatively efficient, shares some favorable characteristics of FEM
			% penalty terms are needed to enforce BCs & weak continuity
			% penalty parameters are problem dependent, must be chosen carefully
		% Weak Galerkin methods
			% more recently developed approach
			% can handle arbitrary polytopal element domains
			% based on the notion of weak derivatives
			% similar in some respects to DG methods; polynomial basis functions
			% dofs stored in element domains, and on element boundaries
			% weak derivative property avoids need for penalty terms (unlike DG)
			% may result in a large number of unknowns, less efficient
			% current formulations place limits on element geometry

	% Polygonal and Polyhedral methods
		% element geometry made to be more flexible (arbitrary)
			% opens up new possibilities for meshing
		% construct basis functions directly on the elements (no isoparametric map)
		% basis functions possess compact support; numerically efficient
		% mesh boundaries again well-defined; good for contact & BC enforcement
		% techniques developed for efficient domain integration (Sukumar, Mousavi)

	% New discretization methods have made polyhedral meshing more accessible
		% Voronoi meshing has made leaps and bounds in recent years (Ebeida)
		% Efforts made toward hex mesh intersection with B-rep geometry (Celeris)

	% Justify current demand for reliable and robust polyhedral element methods

\section{Recent Developments in Polyhedral Discretizations} % (polyhedral finite element methods)

	% Reiterate the main motivation behind polyhedral discretizations
		% Want to avoid meshing limitations while preserving desirable FEM properties
			% definition of quadrature rules & precise boundary description

	\subsection{Continuous Interpolation on Arbitrary Polytopes}
		% Overview of efforts to define interpolants directly on polytopal domains
		% Briefly describe the idea of generalized barycentric coordinates
			% harmonic/Laplace coordinates
			% Waschpress coordinates
			% maximum entropy coordinates
		% Require significant number of quadrature points to retain accuracy
		% Many approaches are limited by restrictions on element geometry/convexity

	\subsection{Virtual Element Methods}
		% Overview of virtual element methods (avoids definition of SFs on element domains)
		% never explicitly constructs/represents shape functions on elements
		% considers ``virtual'' shape functions, projected onto a polynomial subspace
		% exploits linearity of bilinear form to separate consistency & stability terms
		% consistency term formed by low-order polynomial projection of virtual SFs
		% stability term formed by higher-order projection, scaled by HG parameter
		% limited in applicability to linear problems (some efforts toward nonlinear)
		% stabilization still a somewhat ad hoc procedure

	\subsection{Approximate Interpolation on Arbitrary Polytopes}
		% Overview of efforts to define shape functions only loosely over element domains
		% Somewhere in between the barycentric coordinate-type elements, and the VEM
		% VETFEM (variable element topology finite element method)
			% define SFs as polynomials, subject to continuity requirements
			% suffers from robustness issues
		% DDPFEM (discrete data polyhedral finite element method)
			% define only SF values and gradients at discrete points
			% requires a partition of the element into cells
			% element formulation more robust with finer partition
		% PEM (partitioned element method)
			% embraces element partition idea
			% construct SFs in hierarchial manner, assume SFs piecewise polynomial
		% Joe Bishop's version of FE-based approximants w/ Laplace shape functions
			% similar in concept: discretize element domain
			% use FE basis functions on a local tet mesh, solve Laplace equation

	% Lead into the present work, following last category: ``partitioned element methods''
		% select the PEM approach as the one of particular interest for this thesis

\section{Scope of the Present Work}
