\acknowledgments{Many thanks to the following: Professor Amit Kanvinde who inspired much of my initial motivation for applying to graduate school; Professor N. Sukumar for exposing me to the realm of computational solid mechanics; Dr. Joseph Bishop at Sandia for being involved in my early (and continuing) development in the field of solid mechanics; Professor Mark Rashid who turned my spark of interest in the subject into a roaring fire of passion; Dr. Steven Wopschall and Mr. Omar Hafez for being my mentoring older brothers throughout my journey in graduate school; Mr. Subhajit Banerjee and Mr. Eric Chin whose fruitful discussions assisted greatly in developing a personal sense of calm and confidence prior to my qualifying examination; Professor Yannis Dafalias, Professor John Bolander, and Professor Elbridge Puckett, whose enthusiasm as lecturers and courtesy as QE examiners were indespensible; Dr. Joseph Jung, Dr. Kendall Pearson, Dr. Nathan Crane, Mr. Mark Merewether, Dr. Michael Tupek, and the whole of the Sierra Solid Mechanics Team at Sandia who introduced me to the fascinations of code development; Ms. Carly Arthur, Mr. Sam Mish, and Ms. Aim\'{e}e Sylvia whose conversations as fellow class-mates and advisees were incredibly helpful and insightful; and foremost to Ms. Maha Kenawy, who has served as my primary role-model and source of inspiration for completing this thesis -- I love you.}

\UMIabstract[The abstract that is submitted to UMI must be formatted as shown in the example here. The body of the abstract cannot exceed 350 words. It should be in typewritten form, double-spaced, and on bond paper. It is important to write an abstract that gives a clear description of the content and major divisions of the dissertation, since UMI will publish the abstract exactly as submitted. Students completing their requirements under Plan A should provide extra copies of the typed summary for use by the dissertation committee during the examination.
